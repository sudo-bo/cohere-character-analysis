                                     COUNSELOR MACKEY
                         N'kay, kids, as your counselor, I know 
                         it can sometimes be difficult to talk 
                         about subjects like drugs and sex and 
                         alcohol, m'kay? So, as you remember, 
                         last week I told you to write down any 
                         difficult questions you had and put 
                         them in this box anonymously so we could 
                         discuss in class, m'kay? I got a lot 
                         o' responses, so let's read some aloud. 
                          "Mr. Mackey is gay."  Okay kids, that 
                         is not funny! Unkay?! This box is supposed 
                         to be used for serious questions! About, 
                         about serious issues! M'kay, let's let's 
                         stop the tomfoolery!  M'kay, this looks 
                         like a real one here.  "Dear Mr. Mackey, 
                         you are gay."  All right, all right. 
                         That's enough, kids. Let's quiet down 
                         and try to be mature, 'kay?  Uh here 
                         we go. Okay, "Mr. Mackey, sometimes 
                         my parents hit me, and you are gay." 
                          Damnit, is there not one serious question 
                         in here?!  "Mr. Mackey is gay, Mr. Mackey 
                         is gay"  Okay, here.  I am a boy at 
                         South Park Elementary. Sometimes, when 
                         I'm sitting in class, my penis becomes 
                         hard for no reason. What should I do? 
                          All right kids, all right kids, that's 
                         enough!  If you all can't be serious 
                         about the question box,  then we'll 
                         just do drug identification exercises, 
                         unkay?!

                         up here and write down the names of 
                         two narcotics?

                         you!

                         doesn't have to do it?!

                         erections in the classroom.

                          Hey Jimmy, I'm Doctor Pal. That's because 
                         I'm a doctor, but I'm also your pal. 
                         Are we cool?

                         A lot of times parents call me in because

                         down, I'm dope, you dig? Now, I understand 
                         you have some concerns about erections.

                         Jimmy, there's nothing weird about random 
                         erections. Almost every boy goes through 
                         a phase where his penis becomes hard... 
                         for no particular reason. It's just 
                         part of grwoing up. Growing up? Growing 
                         out is more like it.

                         Jimmy, as you get older your body goes 
                         through a lot of changes. Certain hormones 
                         start to release as your whole reproductive 
                         system begins to awaken, and so, if 
                         you like, we can take off our shirts 
                         and kiss.

                         set you off on a different tangent, 
                         got you thinkin' a different way. That's 
                         what Doctor Pal is here to do.  Unless, 
                         of course, you think we should take 
                         off our shirts and kiss.

                         and kiss

                         can just deal with your problems on

                         Wow, what a what a great audience. So 
                         apparently Martha Stewart is out of 
                         jail. Have you have you heard about 
                         this, have you seen this? She's very 
                         excited to get started on her new show, 
                         "Martha Stewart Living, with an electronic 
                         ankle bracelet."  So it looks like the 
                         Vatican has finally chosen a new Pope. 
                         Have you seen this, have you heard about 
                         this?  A-a-apparently they're going

                         have a little talk.  You see, Jimmy, 
                         when a man's penis becomes hard, the 
                         man puts it into a lady. Into her "vagiiina." 
                          Then, the hard penis sneezes milk inside 
                         the lady's tummy, and after it's all 
                         done sneezin' milk.thepenis stops bein' 
                         hard, and the man loses interest in 
                         the lady.
 
                                     JIMMY
                         So, when your penis becomes hard, you're 
                         supposed to put in in a lady's vagina. 
                         And then it stops being hard?
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         That's right, Jimmy.

                         performers to get through, so the quicker 
                         you shut up, the quicker this will be 
                         over!  Okay, first up we have Billy 
                         Turner, from the third grade, who will 
                         be doing an alto sax solo.

                         have it in their vaginas? It's like

                         and pure. They're not like the ladies

                         ...and get down there before the talent 
                         show ends. Th-thanks, Officer Barbrady!
