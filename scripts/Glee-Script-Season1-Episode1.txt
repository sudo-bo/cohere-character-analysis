BLACKNESS. In the void, a sound...CLAPPING. In SYNCOPATION
with FOOT STOMPING...a crazed crowd demanding a show.

Suddenly, a slit APPEARS in the blackness...which we now
realize is a black velvet curtain. A SWEET NERVOUS TEENAGE
BOY peers out. His POV: it’s terrifying...a HUGE SOLD OUT
AUDITORIUM, everyone vibrating with anticipatory frenzy.

TITLES UP: EPCOT CENTER, GLEE CLUB NATIONALS, 1993.
INT. BACKSTAGE EPCOT THEATRE -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

The NERVOUS TEEN, in a TUX, joins twenty other or so TEENS as
they stretch, practice scales, etc. One GIRL is even looking
in a mirror, practicing a HUGE SMILING SHOW FACE. Suddenly,
their teacher LILLIAN ADLER, 50s, appears from the wings,
claps her hands for their attention.

MRS. ADLER
Show circle, everybody.

The teens grasp hands in a circle around Mrs. Adler, which is
difficult to do because she’s obese.

MRS. ADLER (CONT’D)
Welcome to nationals.

The kids whoop and scream with delight.

MRS. ADLER (CONT’D)
Fantastic. Use that excitement on
the stage today. But I want you
guys to remember something.

PUSH IN ON THE YOUNG NERVOUS TEENAGE BOY as she continues.

MRS. ADLER (CONT'D)
Glee club isn’t about competition,
it’s not about shiny trophies. It‘s
about something deeper than that --
realizing your potential. Utilizing
your gifts. Even by its very
definition in Mr. Webster's book,
glee...is about opening yourself up
to joy.

(then, off their awe)

Eyebrows up, everybody.

ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
Ladies and gentlemen...please
welcome to the stage, from Lima,
Ohio...The Harrison High
Singsations!
INT. EPCOT THEATRE -- DAY

Horns BLARE. Hips SHIMMY. Clumps of students whip around in
succession, beaming with optimism and enthusiasm, painting
rainbows of joy with their arms as they sing “Brand New Day”
from “The Wiz.”

THE SINGSATIONS
“CAN YOU FEEL A BRAND NEW DAY? CAN
YOU FEEL A BRAND NEW DA-A-A-AYI!!"

The group FLIES into an impromptu dance break, whooping to
each other and exchanging ad lib high fives, then WHIPPING
back into formation with military precision. Their dancing is
youthful and acrobatic, and the crowd roars to its feet. As
tambourines fly into their hands and the lights start to
strobe, we PAN the young sweaty faces. The kids are excited,
overwhelmed with joy.

THE SINGSATIONS (CONT'D)
“CAN YOU FEEL A BRAND NEW DAY! ! i"

The band screams to the finish, and the choir hits its final
position, arms straining, faces busting with smiles that they
try to hold through their panting, trying desperately not to
scream in ecstasy. CLOSE on our NERVOUS YOUNG MAN near the
back, arms up, eyes open wide: the world has just opened up
to him. SMASH TO BLACK.

TITLE UP
“GLEE”
INT. SCHUESTER APARTMENT -- DINNERTIME -- 2008

TIGHT on a HALF-EMPTY BOTTLE OF KRAFT LITE RANCH DRESSING.
WILL SCHUESTER -- thirty, naturally optimistic -- pours a
DOLLOP on his iceberg salad, then smiles at his wife TERRI
across the card table they use as a dining room.

WILL
How was work today?

TERRI

(dry)
I manage a store called Sheets N’
Things. I folded sheets.

Silence as they eat. Then, trying really hard --
WILL

I wish you could have seen Glee
Club rehearsal yesterday, Terr.
TERRI
God I miss smoking...

WILL

The new number is going to take us
to nationals. I’m feeling it.

(then, sexy)
You know, the District pays for the
trip to Orlando. Maybe I could
convince them to let you tag along
as my “assistant.”

That gets Terri’s ear.

TERRI

They pay for the whole trip?
WILL

Hotel, bus tickets -- three days

four nights of sun, fun and show
stopping excitement.

TERRI
Wow. Epcot. You don’t think they’d
put us up in the Grand Floridian do
you? The Polynesian's nice too.

WILL
I think they usually get us rooms
at the Motel Six.
(as she deflates)
Maybe I could get them to book us
at the Floridian if I offered to
pay the difference?

TERRI
Sure, maybe we could trade in some
of your stock options.
(then)
All I’m going to say is they’re
hiring at HW Menken...

WILL
I’m not going back to accounting,
Terri. Remember what happened? I
got a vitamin D deficiency from the
florescent lights.

TERRI
All I remember is your paychecks
were twice as big. You were an
economics major in college, Will.
WILL
And when I tried it I was
miserable. I need something
more...creative.

The moment resonates. This was and will always be the central
conflict in their marriage. Terri pours what's left of the
DRESSING on her salad. Then, pissed --

TERRI
You need to get more when the
bottle is half-empty.

WILL
Or half-full. I just figured that
since Sheets N’ Things is next to
the supermarket, you could pick up
whatever we need on the way home.

TERRI

Doctor Musky said I have to start
relaxing if we want to conceive.
You know what she told us about the
shape of my uterus. I’m in charge
of two part-time employees. I don’t
need the added stress of making
sure we have enough condiments at
home.

(then)
Sometimes I think you care more
about those kids than you do about
me.

WILL
Baby, no. You’re right. I’1l stock
up on everything tomorrow.

She smiles -- mission accomplished.

WILL (CONT'D)

Hey, maybe after we do a little
conceiving this weekend you could
come with me to Wal-Mart. I need to
pick up some more top hats and

canes.

TERRI
Is the District paying for them,
too?

WILL

They're just felt hats, I didn‘t
think...

TERRI
You never think, Will, you just do
what feels good. You teach high
school, you‘re not in it anymore.
Anyway, you can forget it. We need
to dip into the emergency fund, the
muffler fell off the Civic again.

She clears her plate, leaving him alone at the table. As Will
SLUMPS, a GLEE CLUB starts singing a MEDIOCRE version of “Sit
Down You’re Rocking the Boat.”

EXT. WILL'S CAR -- THE NEXT MORNING

TIGHT on the busted muffler, DRAGGING along the blacktop.
The song continues as we drive though downtown Lima, Ohio.

EXT. HARRISON HIGH -- MORNING

Will, brown bag lunch in one hand, briefcase in the other,
passes a PACK OF JOCKS and an INDIAN STUDENT -- RAJEESH.

WILL
Making some new friends, Rajeesh?

PUCK, a MANCHILD answers for Rajeesh.

PUCK
Totally, Mr. Shue.

Will points at FINN HUDSON, a handsome jock who looks too
kind to be hanging out with the rest of the motley crew.

WILL
You still owe me that report on
“Que Hace in su verano pasado",
Finn.
(off Finn’s confusion)
What you did last summer.

FINN
Almost half way done with almost
all of it, Mr. Shue.

Will likes Finn. Then with a wink --

WILL
Four o’clock in the auditorium,
Rajeesh.

He smiles at them and enters the school, feeling good about
his connection with the student body. As soon as he’s gone,
Puck SCOOPS up Rajeesh and carries him towards a DUMPSTER.
RAJEESH
Please -- this is my new satin
Browns jacket purchased from Dick’s
Sporting Goods.

FINN
Wait.

He pulls Rajeesh down, then gently pulls off the scared
freshman’s new orange jacket, folds it under his arm.

FINN (CONT’D)
Ok.

Puck picks up a jacketless Rajeesh, TOSSES him in the
dumpster.

INT. HARRISON HIGH -- MORNING

Will walks the halls. Typical Midwest student body. A few
KIDS greet Will with an “hola.”

He passes the school’s TROPHY CASE and stops, moved. We PUSH
IN on A FRAMED PICTURE OF MRS. ADLER. Underneath the picture:
“LILLIAN ADLER, 1937-1997.” And then a quote: “By its very
definition, Glee is about opening yourself up to Joy.”

Next to the photo tribute: a LARGE TROPHY. PUSH IN on the
award, the engraving reads 1993 SHOW CHOIR CHAMPIONSHIPS,
ORLANDO FLORIDA -- HARRISON HIGH FIRST PLACE. The trophy and
all it represents HAUNTS Will. “Sit Down” continues as we
enter --

INT. GIRLS BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

FIND RACHEL BERRY, at the mirror, making herself up. Her
makeup is way too THEATRICAL. A couple of other GIRLS come
in, check her out, giggle.

GIRL
Getting ready for the tranny prom,
Rachel?

Rachel takes out her can of AQUA NET and unapologetically
sprays her hair -- HEAVILY, gassing the girls away. As soon
as they’re gone, Rachel takes herself in, has a moment of
doubt -- she’s so lonely. She pushes the feelings way down
inside, regains her determination and continues SPRAYING.

INT. WILL’S CLASSROOM -- DAY

The song CONTINUES. The room is decorated with MAPS of
MEXICO.
Will is running a full classroom of STUDENTS through the
conjugation of the verb “to be.” He spies the clock on the
wall. RACK FOCUS to the clock -- 2:45. He speeds up the
exercise until the BELL RINGS and everyone rushes out.

WILL
Hasta manana.

Will excitedly loosens his tie, grabs a pile of SHEET MUSIC
from his drawer and is out the door before the last student.

INT. AUDITORIUM -- DAY

Will carefully watches what we now see is the source of this
particular rendition of the “Guys and Dolls” classic --
Harrison High’s Glee Club. The kids aren’t just singing,
they’re dancing, waving their jazz hands.

It’s not much of a choir. Just five kids, all OUTCASTS. One,

ARTY ABRAMS, is paralyzed from the waist down. Arty belts out
his solo.

Arty’s got heart, but he can’t really sing. Rachel tries to
LINE DANCE with Rajeesh, but he's dyslexic and can’t figure
out his rights from his lefts. The song and TITLE SEQUENCE
ENDS, everyone turns to Will for guidance. Until --

RACHEL
We suck.

WILL
It will get there -- we just need
to keep rehearsing.

RACHEL
Mr. Schuester -- do you have any
idea how ridiculous it is to give
the lead solo in “Sit Down You're
Rocking the Boat” to a kid ina
wheelchair?

A beat, he hadn't. Arty jumps in to save him.
ARTY
I think Mr. Shue was using irony to
enhance the performance.
Will nods. Yeah, what he said. Rachel vibrates with fury.
RACHEL
There’s nothing ironic about show

choir!

She storms out. Slow PUSH IN on Will's sad face as --
WILL (V.0.)

Rachel was right...we do suck. We
might be the worst glee club in the
state. I guess now’s as good a time
as any to explain how I ended up
coaching these kids. It all started
in the late ‘90s, with Mrs. Adler’s
replacement...Sandy Ryerson.

cut TO:
INT. AUDITORIUM -- DAY -- FLASHBACK

SANDY RYERSON, 35, with highlights and a pastel sweater
thrown over his shoulders, coaches the kids. It’s a mess. He
keeps moving all of the girls to the back in order to feature
all of the young, buff boys, regardless of their skill. For
some reason, every member of the choir is holding a STOOL.

WILL (V.O.)
Sandy loved props. Mrs. Adler used
to say that the only prop you
really needed to perform well was
your enthusiasm. In the span of one
year, Harrison became the bottom
feeders of the glee world -- we
were a “stool choir."

As the rehearsal continues, girls begin DISAPPEARING.
They're dropping out, so are some of the better boy dancers --
just DISSOLVING away.

WILL (V.0.) (CONT'D)
Years passed. Glee fell from grace.
It was no longer a place where you
went with dreams of being a star,
it was a haven for outcasts, kids
with no self-esteem who weren't
smart enough to join the math club
but needed a place to go after
school to keep from getting beaten

up.

Finally, everyone has disappeared except for Rachel, Rajeesh,
Arty, MERCEDES (a heavyset African-American) TINA, who
TWITCHES and HANK -- the last of the “in crowd” still in Glee
Club.

INT. CHOIR ROOM -- DAY -- FLASHBACK

Hank leans on the baby grand holding his stool, nervous, as
Sandy, now 45 and still sporting highlights despite a bad
bald spot, enters, spraying breath spray in his mouth.

WILL (V.O.)
Still, the school didn’t care -- as
long as Sandy came in under budget.
He would probably still be teaching
today if he had been able to
control himself.

SANDY
This is a song about wanting
someone, Hank. You know you
shouldn't give into temptation, but
something about it feels so
right...

HANK
I don’t know, Mr. Ryerson. I mean,
I‘m only here because the guidance
counselor said being in Glee Club
would help me get into OSU. I mean,
this is kind of not cool anymore.

SANDY
Is that why you’re here? To be
cool? Guess what, bud, stars aren’t
cool, they burn -- hot.

HANK
What do I do with the stool?

SANDY
Forget the stool. Sing.

Hank thinks he understands. Sandy starts playing the PIANO
and Hank breaks into a mediocre rendition of “Where Is Love?”
from “Oliver!” Sandy is moved by the performance. When Hank
gets to the chorus, Sandy softly sings along with him.

As they continue, Sandy takes a hand off the keys and places
it firmly on Hank’s. He’s coming on to Hank, there’s no doubt
about it. ZAP ZOOM to the closed glass doorway, revealing
RACHEL. She’s jealous Hank is getting the solo.

INT. PRINCIPAL FIGGINS’ OFFICE -- DAY -- FLASHBACK

A CRYING Sandy, a SECURITY GUARD behind him, sits across from
a stern looking PRINCIPAL FIGGINS, 40s.
10.

FIGGINS
My hands are tied, Sandy. We cannot
afford another lawsuit.

SANDY
But I’m not even gay!

As Sandy weeps gay tears -—-

WILL (V.0.)
There was a vacancy, and fate
called on me to fill it.

INT. TEACHER‘’S LOUNGE -- DAY -- FLASHBACK

Will goes to get coffee, but there’s no pot. He turns to his
buddy, KEN TANAKA, the history teacher/football coach.

WILL
Where’s the coffee machine?

KEN TANAKA
Figgins got rid of it. Budget cuts.
I know for a fact they’re still

getting hot java over at Carver. We
should strike.

As Will sighs, sits and starts eating his brown bag lunch,
EMMA PILLSBURY, the school guidance counselor, enters and
sits. Emma‘s pretty, but she doesn’t think she is.

KEN TANAKA (CONT'D)

(flirty)
Hey Emma.
EMMA
(not flirty)
Hey, Ken.
(then, trying to be cool)
Hey, Will.

Emma pulls a HANDY WIPE out of her purse, starts CLEANING the
table in front of her. Will watches as she meticulously
scrubs her place setting, then takes her own plastic
silverware, plate and cup out of her bag. She notices the
stares, smiles nervously hoping they won’t talk about her
ocD, then puts her LUNCH on her plate and starts eating.

KEN TANAKA
I didn‘t see you at the singles
mixer last weekend, Emma.
EMMA
Oh, yeah, I didn’t go. A pipe
exploded in my building. It was
wild. Fire trucks, police. I think
it was on the local news. Did you
see it Will?

WILL
(trying to be nice)
Sure, maybe.

A beat. She desperately wants to get Will’s attention.

EMMA
I hate those mixers, anyway. Just
a big meat market.
(then)
I gave one of the firemen my phone
number, but he hasn’t called yet.

WILL
Forget him. You need to wait for
someone special. You deserve it,
Emma.

She smiles, blushes, goes back to her food. Then —-

EMMA
Hey, did you hear they fired Sandy
Ryerson?
Will's ears perk up.
WILL
Really? Who’s going to take over
Glee Club?
INT. PRINCIPAL FIGGINS’ OFFICE -- DAY -- FLASHBACK

An excited Will sits across from Figgins.

WILL
I‘d like to take over Glee Club.

FIGGINS
You want to captain the Titanic,
too?

WILL
I think I can make it great again.
Everything is standardized nowadays
-- fill in the bubble, there’s no
joy in these kids.

(MORE )

11.

12.

WILL (CONT'D)
They feel anonymous, invisible.
That's why every one of them has a
Myspace page. They need outlets
like Glee where they can explore
unknown parts of themselves, find
out who they are and what their
potential is.

Figgins thinks. Then -—-

FIGGINS
Sixty bucks a month. That‘s what I
need to keep the program up.

WILL
And you expect me to pay it?

FIGGINS
I’m certainly not going to. These
toe-grabbers down at the budget
office count me down to the penny,
Shue. The penny. And you've got to
use the costumes and props we

already have -- no new stuff. Oh,
but we need the stools for wood
shop.

off Will, unsure, we CUT TO:
INT. SCHUESTER APARTMENT -- DAY -- FLASHBACK

TERRI
Sixty dollars a month!

WILL
I’m sure it will only be for a
couple of months. Once we win a few
competitions, I’‘1ll be able to ask
for a raise, Terri.

Terri just stares, deeply disappointed, before heading to the
bedroom.

WILL (CONT’D)
Where are you going?

TERRI
To bed. Don’t forget to vacuum.

She slams the door shut.
INT. SCHUESTER BEDROOM -- THE MIDDLE OF THAT NIGHT

Will stares up at the ceiling.
13.

WILL (V.0O.)
I knew Terri would understand once
she saw us perform. But how was I
going to get these kids motivated
again? One thing I knew for sure,
we needed a new name. Sandy’s
“Rhythm Explosion” didn’t cut it.
We needed something worthy of Mrs.
Adler. Something that would bring
Harrison High back to its glory
days.

Will pops up in bed, eyes wide with excitement -- he has it.
INT. HARRISON HIGH -~ AUDITORIUM -- DAY -- FLASHBACK

Will pins up a SIGN UP SHEET, then walks away to reveal the
NAME printed in bold letters on the top of the page -- “SIGN
UP HERE FOR “NEW DIRECTIONS!”

QUICK CUTS: Shyly, Arty, Rajeesh, Mercedes and Tina sign in,
then exit, hoping no one picks on them. Finally Rachel
proudly strides to the sheet, and signs in. After her name
she draws a big, cartoon STAR.

RACHEL (V.O.)
You might laugh because every time
I sign my name I put a gold star
after it. But it’s a metaphor, and
metaphors are important. My gold

stars are a metaphor for me being a
star.

She turns around, very self-satisfied. Puck throws a Big Gulp
at her head. Freeze frame as it hits her.

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY -- DAY -- FLASHBACK
Rachel speed walks down the hall, on a mission.

RACHEL (V.0.)

And just so we’re clear, I want to
clear up that hateful rumor that I
was the one who turned Sandy
Ryerson in. That’s horsepucky.

INT. PRINCIPAL FIGGINS’ OFFICE -- DAY -- FLASHBACK
Rachel sits across from Figgins, crying melodramatically.
RACHEL

.--and he was touching Hank,
caressing him...it was so wrong!
14.

Principal Figgins, upset growing, hands her a Kleenex.

RACHEL (V.O.) (CONT’D)
I am NOT homophobic. In fact, I
have two gay dads.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY -- FLASHBACK

TIGHT ON AMBER, A YOUNG WHITETRASH MOTHER, screaming in agony
as she begins her final contractions.

RACHEL (V.0O.)
See, I was born out of love.

REVEAL A GAY COUPLE -- JOE, white, 40s and fat, and BRUCE,
black 40s and very thin -- assisting in the delivery.

AMBER
Get this thing out of me!

RACHEL (V.0.)

My two dads screened potential
surrogates based on beauty and IQ.
Then they mixed their sperm
together and used a turkey baster.

INT. JOE AND BRUCE'S HOUSE -- DAY -- FLASHBACK

Amber devours free ice cream as Bruce and Joe coo to her
pregnant stomach and rub coco butter on it.

RACHEL (V.0.)
Every day until I was born, they
talked to me through my host
mother’s uterine wall.

JOE
(to the belly)
You’‘re the chosen one, baby.

BRUCE
(to the belly)
You’re destined for greatness.

RACHEL (V.O.)

To this day, we don’t know which
one is my real dad, which I think
is pretty amazing.

INT. BALLET CLASS -- DAY -- FLASHBACK

Little Rachel takes her first class.
15.

RACHEL (V.0O.)
My dads spoiled me in the arts, I
was given dance lessons, vocal
lessons --

Joe and Bruce snap photos wildly, blinding one little girl
who crashes into a wall.

INT. OHTO TANNING SALON -- DAY -- FLASHBACK

Rachel, wearing a swimsuit, scrunches up her eyes as she is
given a spray-on-tan by a gum-chewing TANNING REPRESENTATIVE.

RACHEL (V.0O.)
From modeling to beauty maintenance
that gives me a competitive edge,
my gay dads have inspired me to be
the very best.

Rachel is vaguely orange now, an ambitious Oompa Loompa.

INT. RACHEL’S ROOM -- DAY -- FLASHBACK

Rachel is at her computer in a Pepto Bismol pink bedroom.
Canopy bed, Hannah Montana posters and pageant sashes
EVERYWHERE.

RACHEL (V.0.)

You might think that all the boys
at school would totally want to tap
this, but my YouTube schedule keeps
me way too busy to date.

She types vigorously.

RACHEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I try to post a YouTube video every
day, just to keep my talent alive
and growing.

Rachel checks her video recorder, jumps up on her bed and
belts “Look At Me, I’m Sandra Dee!” from “Grease.”

RACHEL (V.O.) (CONT’D)
Nowadays, being anonymous is worse
than being poor. Fame is the most
important thing in our culture now.
And if there’s one thing I’ve
learned, it’s that no one is gonna
just hand it to you.
16.

LATER

Rachel, biting her lip, scrolls through her YouTube feedback:
"Why don't you die already?"

“Your videos make me want to kill my entire family.”

RACHEL (V.0.)
My YouTube feedback is always
encouraging me to take my starpower
to a national level...

CU on a single line of feedback: “You should go on American
Idol.”

RACHEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
..-because what’s the point of
doing anything anymore if nobody’s
watching you do it?

INT. AMERICAN IDOL AUDITION -- DAY -- FLASHBACK

Rachel finishes her “Sandra Dee” number. But she’s nervous,

trying too hard, not at her best. Silence. The judges regard
her, then --

RANDY JACKSON
Naw, dawg. Too pitchy.

PAULA ABDUL
(struggling to be nice)
You’re a doll, you really are, but
I don’t think this competition is
for you, sweetie.

Rachel is shocked. Then --

SIMON
Rachel, you strike me as a girl who
people don’t like very much.

EXT. IDOL AUDITION ROOM -- THIRTEEN SECONDS LATER

Rachel comes bawling out of the room, no golden ticket. Her
dads envelop her supportively. Rachel just cries and cries,
feeling the universal pain of rejection.

JOE
(gently)
Maybe next year, honey. There’s
always next year...
17.

INT. AUDITORIUM -—- DAY

TIGHT, at ground level, on a pair of Hush Puppy covered FEET.
The right one starts TAPPING.

WILL (0.8.)
Five, six, seven, eight...

The feet start DANCING. PAN UP to reveal Will, singing “Sit
Down” as he patiently demonstrates some choreography to the
glee club. SHIMMY, SHUFFLE STEP, HOP -- he’s actually pretty
good. More than that, he’s HAPPY.

The kids are another matter. They’re in costume -- the girls
in POLYESTER, PLEATED BURGUNDY DRESSES (castoffs from an
upscale hillbilly wedding or a prom during the Carter
administration); the boys in POWDER BLUE TUXEDOS.

WILL (CONT’D)
Pretty simple stuff -- any
questions?

MERCEDES
I‘m not wearing this.

WILL
Those costumes are good luck. The

‘93 team took nationals wearing
them.

MERCEDES

I know -- I can still smell them.
Whoever wore this dress before me
clearly had the stink ass.

(adamant )
I want a new costume. I sew all my
own clothes anyway. I’m the only
designer that can make this booty
sing.

WILL
I’m sure you do a heck of a job,
but we don’t have the money to buy
enough fabric for you to make new
costumes for everyone. I'll take it
to the dry cleaners for you.

MERCEDES
You can take it to the moon, baby --
everyone knows you can’t get stink
ass out of polyester.

Rachel shakes her head, unable to hide her frustration.
18.

MERCEDES (CONT’D)
You want to be startin’ somethin’,
Britney?

Staredown, until Rachel breaks and storms out.

WILL
Take five, everybody.

EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD -- BLEACHERS -- DAY

Rachel, in her horrible dress, sits high up in the stands.
She stares down at THE CHEERLEADERS...the popular ones.
Everything seems so easy for them. REVEAL Will climbing up.
He sits next to her. Silence, then --

WILL
You’re the best kid in there,
Rachel -- but that comes with a

price. The other kids are looking
to you for guidance. You've got to
be more optimistic.

RACHEL
You sound like my dads -- “power of
positive thinking,” “there's always

next year” and all of that.

(with emotion)
I know I’m just a sophomore but I
can feel the clock ticking away. I
don’t want to leave high school
with nothing to show for it.

WILL
You get great grades, you’re a
fantastic singer...

RACHEL
(vulnerable)
Everybody hates me.

Now he understands.

WILL
And you think Glee Club is going to
change that?

RACHEL
Being great at something is going
to change it. Being part of
something special...makes you
special. Right?
19.

Will can certainly relate to that. A beat, he thinks.

WILL

What if I give you all the solos?
RACHEL

Glee club isn’t about solos -- it’s

about duets, it’s a team sport. I
need a male lead who can keep up
with me vocally.

WILL
Maybe if I tutor Arty a little...

RACHEL
Look, Mr. Shue. I really appreciate
what you're trying to do, but if
you can’t get me what I need, I’m
sorry...I’m not going to make a
fool of myself. I can’t keep
wasting my time with Glee -- it
hurts too much.

Will sits there, pondering his next move when A WHISTLE
BLASTS. Will sees Coach Ken, at the base of the bleachers.

KEN TANAKA
Schuester! Figgins wants you.

INT. PRINCIPAL FIGGINS’ OFFICE --— DAY
A dejected Will looks RIGHT INTO THE CAMERA.

WILL
But we just started rehearsals.

FIGGINS
My hands are tied, Shue, I need the
auditorium. Alcoholics Anonymous
wants to rent it out for their
afternoon meetings. Lots of drunks
in this town, and they’re paying me
ten bucks a head. I’m sorry, you
gave it a hell of a run, but Glee
Club is over.

A beat, as Figgins waits for Will to leave. Will sits still,
though -- he won't give this up. PUSH IN on his PANIC, then --

WILL
Give me two months. If we show at
Regionals, Glee stays, if not the
bar‘s open in the auditorium.

20.

FIGGINS
What is it with you and this club,
Will? I love to see passion in my
teachers, but this is bordering on
obsession.

SLOW PUSH IN on Will. Then, with personal conviction --

WILL
I was reading a study where they
put these rats in a maze -- not a

normal one, a really hard one. In
three months, not one rat had made
it through. Then they started
giving rats creative tasks, stuff
to stimulate the “artistic” part of
their brains. Within a week, every
single rat had found its way out.

FIGGINS
Will, it’s time to let it go.
You’ve only got five kids -- one of

them's a cripple.

WILL
Then I guess you‘ve got nothing to
worry about.

Figgins leans back in his chair, thinks.
FIGGINS
Fine, two months -- but you’re
running detention for free to make
it up to me.

WILL
Deal.

They SHAKE on it. Off Will, having no idea how he’s going to
pull this off we --

END ACT ONE
21.

ACT TWO
EXT. WILL’S CAR -- DAY
TIGHT on the MUFFLER, still DRAGGING.
EXT. SHEETS N‘ THINGS -- PARKING LOT -- DAY

Will gets out of the car. When he closes the door the
muffler finally FALLS OFF and crashes to the asphalt, DEAD.

INT. SHEETS N’ THINGS -- DAY

Terri is showing GINNY, a twenty-something employee with bad
ROOTS, how to fold a FITTED SHEET.

TERRI
You’ve got to stick your hands in
the corners like this, see? Then
bring them together. If you can’t
fold a fitted sheet you can’t work
at Sheets N’ Things, Ginny.

INTERCOM VOICE
Associate to returns.

TERRI
Make sure they have a receipt.

Ginny slinks off as Will arrives. Terri smiles.

TERRI (CONT‘D)
To what do I owe this pleasure?

He goes to kiss her, she pulls away, makes sure no one saw.

TERRI (CONT'D)
Not at work.

Will hides his hurt and holds up a deli bag.

WILL
We've been fighting so much I just
thought I‘d bring you a peace
offering. Roast beef on
pumpernickel -- your favorite.

She takes the bag, willing to forgive. She inspects the
sandwich, then —-

TERRI
You call this light mayo? Are you
trying to sabotage my diet?
(MORE )
22.

TERRI (CONT'D)
If my diabetes comes back I can't
get pregnant.
(then)
What do you want, Will? I know you
-- something’s up.

WILL
I just wanted to tell you that I
have to start working late for the
next couple of months. I'm
monitering after-school detention.

TERRI
They paying you extra for that?

WILL
No, I made a deal with Figgins so
he wouldn’t kill Glee Club.

TERRI
I’m on my feet six hours a day
here, then you want me to come home
and cook dinner for myself?

WILL
T’1l cook in the morning. All you
have to do is warm it up.

(a beat, then vulnerable)
Things are a little hard at school
right now. I guess I just wanted to
come by to talk to you about it.

Before Terri can respond, Ginny returns.

GINNY
This lady wants to return these
sheets, but something tells me
we've got another bedwetter.

She holds up the sheet -- there’s a HUGE STAIN in the middle.

TERRI
We’1l talk about it over dinner,
okay?

Will smiles, nods as they exit. Suddenly, as he goes to
leave, he hears a FAMILIAR VOICE coming from the aisle.

MALE VOICE (0.S.)
And two-hundred is the highest
thread count you have?
23.

Will peeks around a display of VELVETEEN COUCH COZIES to see
Sandy Ryerson talking to a STOCK BOY. The stock boy runs off
to check Sandy's request. Will tries to sneak out, but --

SANDY
William?

WILL
(faking it)
Sandy. Hey!

SANDY
(a little cool)
Well hello. How are things? I hear
you took over Glee Club.

WILL
Yeah, I was going to call you about
that. I hope you’re not too upset.

SANDY
Are you kidding? Getting out of
that swirling eddy of despair was
the best thing that ever happened
to me. Don’t get me wrong, it
wasn’t easy at first. I mean, being
dismissed for what I was accused
of? My long distance girlfriend in
Cleveland nearly broke up with me.
It’s taken me weeks to get over my
nervous breakdown.

WILL

Did they put you on medication?
SANDY

Better -- medical marijuana. It’s

genius. And as long as I tell my
Doctor Feelgood that I can’t sleep,
I can get as much as I want.

WILL

(joking)
You should start selling it.

Sandy just stares at him. Will is shocked, then whispering --

WILL (CONT’D)
You're dealing drugs?
24,

SANDY
I make five times more than I did
teaching. I keep some for myself
and take money baths with the rest.

WILL
But who do you sell it to?

EXT. HARRISON HIGH PARKING LOT -- DAY -- FLASHBACK

Sandy hands a BAGGY of weed to KEN TANAKA, who gladly pays
him while looking over his shoulder.

INT. SHEETS N’ THINGS -- PRESENT DAY

SANDY
You want in?
WILL
No -- I mean I tried it once in

college, but you know, Terri and I
are trying to get pregnant.

Sandy tries to STUFF a bag of weed in Will’s blazer jacket.

WILL (CONT’D)
Sandy, no!

SANDY
Take it -- first sample’s free.
You‘re coaching those tone deaf
retards, you’re going to need it.
(flirty)
Call me.

Will, head down, sneaks out of the store.
INT. EMMA‘S GUIDANCE COUNSELOR OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

A compassionate Emma sits across from JULIETTE, 16, crying,
nine months PREGNANT.

EMMA
I’m not letting you drop out. Your
grades and SAT scores are certainly
good enough for community college.
You made a mistake, you got
pregnant, don’t make another one
and throw your life away.

Juliette is sobbing too hard to respond. Emma hands her a
tissue box, Juliette takes one, BLOWS HER NOSE in it, then
puts the dirty tissue on Emma‘s desk.
25.

JULIETTE
I just feel so stupid and
worthless...

Emma is trying to listen, but she can’t take her eyes off the
dirty tissue soiling her desk. Her OCD is kicking in.

INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA -- AFTERNOON

Will is running afternoon detention. There are three kids in
there, one asleep, DROOLING on his desk, there’s a girl
writing I LOVE MARIO over and over in her note pad and a kid
with a large scar on his head just staring into space.
Will's agitated, bored, thinking about something important.
Finally, he gets up and sneaks out. No one notices.

INT. HALLWAY -- DAY

Juliette leaves the office, followed a beat later by Emma,
holding the girl’s dirty tissue between two MANILA FOLDERS.
She throws everything into a TRASH CAN as Will walks up.

WILL
Hey, you have a minute?

EMMA
(excited, but covering)
Sure, what’s up?

WILL
It’s about Glee Club -- I need some
guys -- some “guys’ guys.” You talk

to almost every kid in this school,
can you think of anyone who might
be interested?

EMMA
Kids follow the leader, Will. Get a
couple of the popular kids to
commit, the rest will fall in line.

WILL
The leaders in this school are the
jocks -- they’re not going to do
it.

EMMA

Teenagers are all about
appearances, they do what they
think is cool, but it’s not always
who they are.

(MORE)
26.

EMMA (CONT'D)
Most of these kids are desperate to
get out of their boxes. Go ask,
maybe you'll be surprised.

They share a warm smile.
INT. LOCKER ROOM -- THE NEXT DAY
The FOOTBALL TEAM is changing. Ken BLOWS HIS WHISTLE.

KEN TANAKA
Circle up, find a seat. Mr.
Schuester is going to talk to you.
You don’t listen, you do laps, you
mouth off, you do laps. Take it,
Will.

Will takes center stage. He‘’s endearingly nervous.

WILL
Hey, guys. I think I know most of
you from Spanish class, but I
wanted to talk to you about
something else -- music. Who are
some of your favorite musicians?

PUCK
Lil’ Wayne.

JOCK #1
Usher.

WILL

Great. All of those guys started
somewhere, right? They didn’t just
wake up one morning and record a
hit album. I’m here to offer you
guys a chance to be like your
heroes, get up on stage.

ANGLE ON Finn...silently riveted...inspired even. But he is
too afraid of peer pressure to show it.

WILL (CONT’D)

Here’s my point -- Glee Club needs
guys.
The guys look at each other -- is this dude serious? Then --
PUCK

I can sing.

WILL
Really? That’s fantastic.
27.

PUCK
Wanna hear?

He gets up and stands next to Will. He closes his eyes as if
about to sing, then FARTS. The crowd goes wild. Puck FLEXES
his biceps. Ken glares at him and MOUTHS “Laps.”

WILL
(trying not to be
discouraged)
I‘m going to hang a sign-up sheet
by the door to the locker room for
anybody’s that interested.

The guys grumble. Ken BLOWS HIS WHISTLE again.

KEN TANAKA
Dismissed.

They disperse. Will looks into Ken’s eyes.

WILL

You been sleeping okay? Your eyes
look bloodshot.

Ken shrugs. As soon as Will’s gone though, a PARANOID Ken
pulls out a tiny bottle of VISINE and drops some in his eyes.

INT. LOCKER ROOM -- TWO DAYS LATER

Will, filled with hope, walks up to the New Directions! sign-
up sheet. People have signed up! The sheet reads: “Gaylord
Weiner.” “Butt Lunch.” “Dick Taco.” A few lines down, just
“Penis.” Will deflates. PUSH IN on his despair as --

WILL (V.0O.)
I honestly thought that was the end
of the very brief fever-dream that
was New Directions!

He hears something.

WILL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
But then, on that fateful day, I
felt the little hairs on the back
of my neck that Terri always told
me to shave stand at attention.

He hears an echoing voice from the locker room singing REO
Speedwagon’s “Can't Fight this Feeling.” Will follows it.
28.

INT. LOCKER ROOM -- CONTINUCUS

Someone is alone in the showers. Will stands listening,
hidden in the shadows, entranced.

VOICE (0.8.)
“And even as I wander/I'm keeping
you in sight...”

It’s FINN HUDSON.

FINN
(stumbling on the lyrics)
“You're a candle in the window and
a corndog late at night...”

WILL (V.O.)
I realized why I had wanted to do
this thing in the first place...it
was seeing a gift in a kid that
they didn’t even know they had.

FINN
“And I’m gettin’ closer than I-I-I
ever thought I M-I-I-I-GHT!!!"

It's totally a ‘70s rock power-ballad-lighter-anthem voice.

WILL (V.O.)
It was pure talent.

FINN
(really wailing now)
“AND I CAN'T FIGHT THIS FEELING
ANYMORE / I'VE FORGOTTEN WHAT I'D
STARTED FIGHTIN’ FO-O-O-RRR..."”

Will’s eyes widen. Something occurs to him.
WILL (V.O.)
What I did next was the blackest
moment of my life.
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. WILL’S EMPTY SPANISH CLASS -- DAY
Will coolly slides Sandy’s bag of marijuana across the desk.
WILL

Wanna tell me how long you’‘ve had a
drug problem?
REVEAL Finn, across from him. Really about to lose it.

WILL (CONT'D)
Look, if it were up to me, we
wouldn’t have mandatory bi-weekly
afternoon locker checks...

FINN
But I’ve never seen that before,
Mr. Shue! I swear!

29.

Finn is so moving in his sincerity, he’s such a good kid,
that it takes everything Will has to continue the charade.

FINN (CONT'D)
It isn’t MINE! I’1l pee in a cup!

A beat. Will is momentarily stymied by this, then --

No idea.

WILL
It wouldn't make any difference,
possession is eight-tenths of the
law. I’m pretty sure this much pot
is a felony. You'll get kicked out
of school, lose your football
scholarship...

FINN
Wait, I was gonna get a
scholarship? To where?

A beat. Struggling, getting back on track --

WILL
You could land in prison, son.

FINN
Oh my God. What is my mom gonna
say?!? Please don’t tell my mom...

WILL

I‘m really...I'm more worried that
you have a serious problem. That's
my main concern. I see a lot of
myself in you. I know what it’s
like to struggle to make good life
choices, and I don’t want to see
you throw away everything you have
to offer the world.

(then)
I just expected more out of you,
Finn.
30.

FINN looks up, destroyed. Freeze frame.

FINN (V.0.)

That really got to me, when Mr.
Schuester said that. Because every
day of my life, I expect more out
of myself.

EXT. DRIVING -- NIGHT -- FLASHBACK

A bunch of football players drive around in PUCK’S MOM’S
Escalade. One of them has a paintball gun. Another
videotapes, so they can post it on YouTube.

FINN (V.0O.)
See, I might look confident and
everything? But I really struggle.

PUCK

Finn. Smell my fingers.
FINN

No.
JOCK #1

Finn, feel my lats.

PUCK
Dude, you've got so much bacne!

JOCK #1
It’s the steroids, dude.

They pull up next to a HOMELESS MAN, pushing a grocery cart.

PUCK
Finn. Do it, dude!

Finn hesitates. He takes the paintball gun.

FINN (V.0.)
I knew what it was like to be poor.

PUCK
I said do it, what are you, a homo?

FINN (V.O.)
I knew how embarrassing it was to
pay for groceries with food
stamps...

Finn closes his eyes, squeezes the trigger, splatters pink on
the homeless man, who maybe doesn’t even notice.
31.

The Escalade erupts with laughter. Puck peels out. CLOSE on
Finn’s guilty face as they all slap him on the back.

EXT. FINN’S HOUSE -- AFTERNOON -- FLASHBACK

A rundown split-level with a brown, patchy lawn. A ten-year-
old Finn and his MOM, CAROLE, bring in groceries from a
Honda.

FINN (V.0.)
I never knew my dad. He died in
Iraq when we were fighting Osama
bin Laden the first time.

INT. FINN’S HOUSE -- AFTERNOON -- FLASHBACK

QUICK CUTS: young Finn puts away the groceries, upset as his
mother battles a bill collector on their rotary wall-phone.

FINN (V.0O.)
My mom and me, we're real close.
But being a single parent can be
really hard. The only good time for
Mom was when we splurged a little
bit and ordered Chem-Lawn.

HEAR the doorbell ring as --
INT. FINN’S HOUSE -- DAY -- FLASHBACK

-- the door opens on a GUY with a mullet and gas-station
flowers.

FINN (V.0.)

Darren was good to her, and he was
really good about letting me tag
along.

EXT. LIMA, OHIO -- DAY -- FLASHBACK

The three drive along, each with a Big Gulp. Finn beams from
the backseat, as Carole leans over and kisses Darren.

CAMERA PUSHES IN on Young Finn’s blue Slurpee smile.

FINN (V.0.)
That was the first time I really
heard music.

Shots of Young Finn and Darren taking in the sights of Lima,
Ohio in the Chem-Lawn truck. They both sing very loud harmony
parts to Journey’s “Lovin’ Touchin’ Squeezin’.”
32.

DARREN
You gotta voice, buddy.

Finn blushes, he’s never gotten a compliment before.

DARREN (CONT'D)
Seriously. If I had your voice, my
band would still be together.
Stick with it buddy.

EXT. FINN’S HOUSE -- DAY -- FLASHBACK

Young Finn plays football with himself on the now beautiful,
green front lawn, throwing the ball across the yard and
running to try to catch it, as Carole sits despondent on the
stoop, staring into the distance.

FINN (V.0.)
My mom took it real hard when
Darren left her for this blonde
woman who was ten years younger...

The CHEM-LAWN truck passes, blasting Journey, a cute BLONDE
GIRL inside. Carole grabs the ball away, runs after the truck
and whips the football at it. It thumps against the back of
the truck, which keeps driving. She remains standing in the
middle of the road, limp, crying, destroyed. PUSH into Young
Finn's reaction.

FINN (V.0.) (CONT’D)
It was at that moment I decided to
do whatever it took to make my mom
proud of me...make her feel all her
sacrifice was worth it.

INT. WILL'S CLASSROOM -- DAY

We’re back at the weed accusation. ANGLE: tears roll down
Finn’s cheeks. Will feels awful.

WILL
Look. We have two options. I’m
running detention now, so you can
do six weeks after school...

Finn nods furiously.
WILL (CONT'D)
..-.but that’1l be on your permanent

record.

FINN
What’s the other option, Mr. Shue?
33.

INT. AUDITORIUM -- DAY

MOVE down a line of SNAPPING FINGERS. The Club is lined up
on stage, snapping, tapping their feet and singing the “ba-
dum, ba-da-da-da-dums” from the top of “Summer Lovin’.”
Rachel stands nearby, confident, head bopping to the beat.

WILL
All right, nice work background.
Now remember, Finn, the tempo is
fast, but this is a love song.
Let’s see what you can do.

Finn, nervous, studies the sheet music, then, after a beat —-

FINN
Summer lovin’, happened so fast.

RACHEL
Summer lovin’, had me a blast.

FINN
(perfect pitch)
Met a girl, crazy for me.

Rachel tosses down her sheet music and SASHAYS towards Finn.

RACHEL
Met a boy, cute as can be.

They’re looking right at each other, she’s totally in love,
he’s a little taken aback by her enthusiasm. The CHORUS kicks
in and the whole gang performs a couple of verses. PUSH IN on
Will...riveted. This is working.

After a lyric or two, the group stops, looks to Will for
direction. He is over the moon. But before he can speak —-

MERCEDES
Hold up, I’m not down with this
background singing nonsense. I'm
Beyonce, I ain’t no Kelly Rowland.

WILL
It’s just one song, Mercedes.

RAJEESH
And it was the first time we have
ever been good.

The rest of the crew agrees. Even Mercedes has to agree.
34.

MERCEDES
Ok, you’re good white boy, I'll
give you that.

They gather around Finn, WELCOMING. Rachel smiles up at him,
totally smitten. Finn doesn’t know what to make of any of
this, he is completely bewildered. Who are these freaks? And
why is this Rachel girl smiling at him like a crazy person?

Will doesn’t care about any of the drama. He just sees Rachel
and Finn standing near each other and feels, for the first
time, a glimmer of hope.

WILL
From the top.

INT. SCHUESTER APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Will and Terri are at the card table, silently putting
together an AMERICAN GOTHIC JIGSAW PUZZLE.

TERRI
Isn’t this fun? And it’s so
challenging.

WILL
So...you want to do this every
week?

TERRI

(with optimism)
Every Wednesday we’ll have puzzle
night. I know how important it is
for you, having a creative outlet,
so I’ve cleared my schedule.

Terri smiles sweetly. A long beat, then --

WILL
The kids have been working so hard.
I was thinking about taking them on
a field trip next Saturday. Carmel
High’s performing a showcase down
in Akron -- can’t hurt to check out
the competition, right? Carmel’s
going to be the team to beat at
Regionals.

She doesn't react, just completes the pitchfork.
35.

WILL (CONT'D)
I thought you might want to come
chaperone it with me -- I don’t
think I can handle six hormonal
kids on my own.

She gets up.

WILL (CONT'D)
Where are you going?

TERRI
To bed.
WILL
But it’s puzzle night.
TERRI
I’m tired -- from trying. And I

can’t make it on Saturday, I picked
up an extra shift at the store so
you won't have to steal baby
formula one day. Find someone else.

Off Will, disappointed we CUT TO:

INT. TEACHER’S LOUNGE -- BULLETIN BOARD -- DAY

Will PINS up a CHAPERONE SIGN UP SHEET. Emma secretly
watches him from a table occupied by TWO OTHER TEACHERS. As
soon as he’s gone, she heads for the sheet, checks it out.
Then, making sure no one is looking, she uses her napkin to
CLEAN the PEN hanging from the sign and volunteers her

services. She looks at her name on the sheet and smiles,
excited for the opportunity to spend time with Will as we...

END AcT TWO
36.

ACT THREE

EXT. PRACTICE FIELD -- DAY

Puck SLAMS into a practice dummy, hard. His tackle partner
doubles over in agony. Puck looks across the field where he
sees Coach Tanaka gesturing wildly at Finn. Finn slumps back
onto the field as Puck catches up to him.

PUCK
What’s going on?

FINN
Oh. Um, I just have to miss
practice Saturday.

PUCK
All afternoon?!

FINN
(bad lying)
It’s my mom. I gotta, like, help
her cook. Do...things.

PUCK
Why?
FINN
Um, she just, like, had surgery.
PUCK
What kind of surgery?
FINN
She, um, had to have her prostate

out.
Puck nods empathetically.

INT. TEACHER’S LOUNGE -- DAY

Will is happily flipping through “Jazzhands!”, the Glee Club
supply catalog. It's suddenly SMACKED out of his hands and
goes flying. It’s Ken Tanaka. He's furious.

KEN TANAKA
What the hell, man?! Glee Club?!
You stole my quarterback!

Will pauses, not wanting to reveal too much.

WILL
Finn’s got a great voice, Ken. He

wants to express himself.
(MORE )
37.

WILL (CONT'D)
It’s a one-time thing. He won‘t
have to miss games or anything...

KEN TANAKA
TRAITOR! You're SCREWING UP MY
LIFE!!!

Will is entirely confused by this passion.

WILL
Ken, you hate football. What’s this
really about?

SMASH CUT TO:

INT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT -- AFTERNOON -- FLASHBACK

Emma is cleaning her door handle with Purell sanitizer before
she touches it. Ken suddenly sidles up.

KEN TANAKA
Hey, Eminem. Soooo...I got me some
tickets to Monster Trucks this
weekend.
(sexy)
Loge tickets.

EMMA
No thanks, not my thing.

KEN TANAKA
Truckzilla vs. Truckasaurus. And
get this...the trucks breathe fire.

Emma pauses, wanting to be kind. Then with a deep breath --

EMMA
Ken, you know how every time you
ask me out I tell you I’m on my
period?

KEN TANAKA
Which doesn’t bother me.

EMMA
Or I say I'm suffering from cluster
headaches? Or how I’m allergic to
nighttime? None of those things are
true. I’m just not interested in
dating you.

KEN TANAKA
What do I have to do...to get your
fine behind in my Scion?
38.

EMMA
(tortured)
Fine Ken, make me say it -- I like
somebody else, okay? There’s
nothing I can do about it, he’s not
even available, it’s just something
I have to deal with.

Ken suddenly realizes who they’re talking about. Hurt, he

turns to go, then comes back, LICKS HIS HAND and SMEARS IT on
her CAR DOOR HANDLE. Off Emma’s horror --

INT. TEACHER’S LOUNGE -- DAY

Ken backs off.

KEN TANAKA
You're right, I'm over-reacting.
The herd will take care of it.

WILL
The herd?

KEN TANAKA
The student body. The second
someone tries to rise above, be
different, the herd pulls him back
down. Contrary to your opinion,
highschool isn’t about being
special -- it’s about communal
pain. Word travels fast, as soon as
they hear about Finn, they're going
to trample him.

He exits. Off Will, worried that this is the truth -—-
EXT. PARKING LOT --— SATURDAY MORNING

Arty is LIFTED into the bus with a HYDRAULIC ELEVATOR as the
kids inside watch, disinterested.

INT. BUS -- DAY

THROUGH THE WINDOWS, the Ohio countryside whizzes past --
CORNFIELDS, CHURCHES. Arty and Tina play rock/paper/scissors
in the back of the bus. Rajeesh is next to Mercedes,
SLEEPING. His head keeps falling onto her shoulder, she keeps
SHOVING it off, irritated, until --

MERCEDES
Rajeesh!

He wakes up, startled.
39.

RAJEESH
I wasn’t touching it, Mom.

MERCEDES

I’ll have you know I ain’t no holla
back girl. I saw the way you were
drooling over my milkshakes.

(off his confusion)
Look, Raj, I know you have feelings
for me, it‘s only natural. But you
wants to play, you gots to pay.

Raj is suddenly excited. A girl likes him!

RAJEESH
You mean like a date? Fantastic!
Would you like to go to the Fun and
Games arcade with me tomorrow?

MERCEDES
Arcade? Ain‘t you been listening?
Mary J. Blige is in town next week
-- if the tickets aren‘t on the
floor, don’t bother.

She turns to look out the window. Rajeesh just sits there,
unsure about what just happened to him.

FIND Finn, alone playing a HAND-HELD VIDEO GAME. Rachel
makes her way back, sits down next to him.

RACHEL
You’re very talented.
FINN
Thanks.
RACHEL
I would know -- I’m very talented,
too.
(then)
I think the rest of the team
expects us to become an item -- you

the hot male lead, me the stunning
ingenue who everyone roots for.

FINN
Oh, well, I have a girlfriend.

RACHEL
(clenching her jaw)
Really? Who?
40.

FINN
Liz Fabray.

RACHEL
The president of the “Celibacy
Club?”

INT. FINN’S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT -— FLASHBACK
Finn is MAKING OUT with Liz on the couch. He tries to get up
her shirt, but she stops him, pulls away, then gets down on

her knees. He's excited for a beat, but then --

LIZ
Let’s pray, Finn.

Off Finn, disappointed --

INT. BUS -- DAY -- PRESENT
FINN
Yeah, for like three months. She’s
cool.

Rachel fumes, then suddenly slaps his face. He’s stunned.

FINN (CONT’D)
What’s that for?

RACHEL
For leading me on.

She flounces to another seat. AT THE FRONT OF THE BUS, Will
sits near Emma. He looks back at the team, all seems well.

WILL
Kids seem to be getting along.

EMMA
You want to go halvsies on a PBJ?

WILL
That sounds perfect.

She reaches into her backpack, puts on a PAIR OF RUBBER
GLOVES then pulls a sandwich out of a CAREFULLY WRAPPED sheet
of TIN FOIL before handing half to Will. He grins -- he
finds her eccentricity endearing -- then takes a bite.

WILL (CONT'D)
I haven’t had one of these ina
long time -- my wife is allergic to
nuts.
EMMA
That's sweet of you -- not eating
something because she can’t. How
long have you guys been married?

WILL
Three years last March -- but we've
been together since highschool. She
was my first girlfriend, actually.

EMMA
Romantic -- she must be pretty
great to have lassoed you.

WILL
Thanks. We’re just real compatible,
you know? She’s the realist, I get
to be the dreamer. I’d be lost
without her. Don’t get me wrong,
she can be tough on me, but it’s
only because she wants me to be a
better person. That’s what
Marriage is about -- you make a
commitment that no matter how good
or bad things are, you‘’re going to
stick it out, keep struggling to
get better...be better.

41.

Emma smiles, bittersweet but really impressed with him. Will

smiles back -- she has a dollop of JELLY on her face. He

reaches up to wipe it off, then remembering her OCD, stops.

WILL (CONT‘D)
You have some jelly.

She blushes, wipes it off herself -- wishing he had done

Next time, don’t even bother
asking. I like everything

WILL
Okay, now I’ve heard these guys are
pretty good, but I honestly don’t
think they've got the talent we’ve
got.

The kids smile, this makes them feel better.

WILL (CONT'D)

But let’s be a good audience, guys,
they’ve worked really hard. Let’s
give ‘em some of that ol’ Harrison
High respect.

Emma smiles shyly, Will is a great teacher. Suddenly, the
lights go down and the audience erupts with anticipation.
Lights start whizzing around as an announcer bellows:

ANNOUNCER
Ladies and gentlemen...welcome to
the Carmel High Fall Invitational
Showcase. We’d like to remind you
that video-recording and flash
photography is prohibited.

The curtain rises and the Carmel High Glee Club is revealed
with their backs to the audience, they are wearing
stunningly beautiful couture dresses and black tuxes. The
Harrison High Glee Clubbers share a worried look -- by
costume comparison, they look like homeless people.

ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
AND NOW...let’s give a warm Buckeye
State welcome to last year’s
regional champions...Vocal
Adrenaline!

The crowd explodes, unable to contain themselves.

VOCAL ADRENALINE SINGER
Five six seven eight!

And the show begins. Vocal Adrenaline begins to roar through
"Let Me Entertain You,” a quick-paced Robbie Williams number.

VOCAL ADRENALINE
"TOOK ME UP IN THE YELLOW PAGES/I
WILL BE YOUR ROCK OF AGES/YOUR SEE
THRU FADS AND CRAZY PHASES YEAH...”

They jump, they bend, they look like they’ve been doing this
for years. All these kids could be on Broadway.
43.

Rachel‘s eyes are saucers. This is the most amazing thing
she's ever seen.

The group splits in two, and the guys come down to the
center. THREE MIRRORED PANELS turn around from the back of
the stage, revealing THREE HORN PLAYERS, who blast the
trumpet part as the rest of the band pulls away.

The crowd is now losing it. Some kids in the audience are
standing, Vocal Adrenaline has groupies, they are trying to
scream above the tidal wave of pitch-perfect sound.

VOCAL ADRENALINE (CONT'D)
“I’M A BURNING EFFIGY/OF EVERYTHING
I USED TO BE/YOU'RE MY ROCK OF
EMPATHY MY DEAR!"

Now the whole choir is moving, formation after stunning
formation, the kids are having the time of their life. They
are black, white, Asian, beaming, singing their hearts out,
dancing their asses off, possessed by the disease known as
“show face.” They are really, really good. It’s breathtaking.

Finn cannot believe what he’s looking at. Rajeesh is near
tears. Mercedes shakes her head back and forth in horror.

VOCAL ADRENALINE (CONT’D)
“LET ME-E-E-E-E-E ENTERTAIN YO-O-O-
O-0-U!!1"

The big finish now. Suddenly, two male Adrenaline members
start executing Olympic-worthy BACKFLIPS ACROSS THE STAGE.

Vocal Adrenaline hits their final position. Sweaty, panting,
looks of complete ecstasy on their faces, they know they are
special. A moment of silence, then the audience leaps to its
feet in a deafening ovation.

Only the New Directions remain in their seats, too
flabbergasted to move. Will looks ashen, Emma looks sick to
her stomach, the kids all look at the floor. PUSH IN ON Tina,
who through her stutter finally says something.

TINA
We’re d-d-d-d-d-doomed.

EXT. LIMA, OHIO -- LATER THAT AFTERNOON
Finn, depressed, is walking home. He senses something behind

him -- is he being followed? He turns, sees nothing, and
continues on.
44,

Behind him, we suddenly see PUCK'S MOM’S ESCALADE come
silently around the corner. Finn can feel it back there,
stalking him. A beat, then he BREAKS OFF RUNNING. Puck hits
the gas, peeling out after him.

Finn turns down an alley, jumps a fence. A couple of JOCKS
jump out of the truck and follow ON FOOT. Puck screams around
the corner, trying to cut Finn off. Finn sprints down the
alley, the guys gaining ground. He’s almost away when Puck
SLAMS ON HIS BRAKES right in front of him, blocking his path.
He’s TRAPPED.

Puck and a couple more JOCKS get out of the car, carrying
PAINT BALL GUNS. They herd Finn toward the wall.

PUCK
Chicks don‘t have prostates, I
locked it up.

He fires a WARNING SHOT that blasts FLORESCENT GREEN PAINT
onto the wall behind Finn.

PUCK (CONT'D)

There are rules, Finn. I don’t know
what they are, but you broke a big

one when you chose those tards over
practice today.

Puck gets Finn’s sleeve with the next shot.

PUCK (CONT'D)
And when you break the rules, you
have to be punished.

Finn's back is up against the wall now. He’s HELPLESS. And he
knows what’s coming. All the guys aim their guns like a
FIRING SQUAD. Suddenly, they OPEN FIRE --

PEPPERING HIM WITH PAINT. The shooting is relentless...like
Sonny Corleone on the causeway.

INT. SCHUESTER APARTMENT -- NIGHT -- LATER

A wary Will enters to find a CONGRATULATIONS BANNER draped in
the ENTRY WAY. Terri skips out of the kitchen, two PLASTIC
FLUTES of what appear to be CHAMPAGNE in her hands. She gives
him one, then wraps him in a BEAR HUG.

TERRI
There’s my baby!
45.

WILL
(moved)
Wow, honey, this is amazing.
But...what’s the congratulations
for? The kids haven‘t won anything
yet.

TERRI
(with quiet emotion)
I‘m pregnant, Will.

Will needs a moment to take that in -- really? She nods, then
smiles, EXCITED. Will‘s OVERWHELMED. He grabs her, pulls her
tight to him, kisses her deeply.

WILL
Oh my God, Ter, this is it -- we're
going to become...a family.

He’s suddenly aware that Terri’s crying.

WILL (CONT’D)
Honey...what’s wrong?

TERRI

Sheets ‘N Things might be closing,
they just shut down the outlet in
Ogden. I don’t know what we're
gonna do, Will.

(then)
We need to start saving for a place
with a third bedroom. This baby
needs a nursery, vaccines...a pony
-~ all the things we never had.
They’re still accepting
applications at HW Menken. It’s not
too late...

WILL
It's just that...I hate the idea of
letting the kids down.

Terri stares for a moment, then with honest reason -—-

TERRI
Will, this isn’t about them -- this
is about you...trying to recapture
your glory days. I’m not the hot
cheerleader anymore, and you're not
the golden boy. High school is
over, okay? For both of us.
WILL
But it’s not over for them. Why is
it so wrong to want to give them
some of the joy we had?

TERRI
Because we don’t have any left to
spare. I've spent years giving up
dreams, letting go of the past,
trying to move forward with you --
now you need to let go of who you
were and accept who you are.

WILL
You fell in love with who I was
back then.

TERRI

I fell in love with who I thought

you had the potential to become.
(then)

Become that promise, Will. If not

for me, for him.

She puts his hand on her belly. DISSOLVE TO...
INT. EMMA’S OFFICE -- DAY
Will enters, depressed.

WILL
Can I have a minute?

The door closes on her look of concern.
INT. AUDITORIUM -- DAY
The kids are absolutely SHOCKED. Then --

ARTY
You're leaving us?

Reveal Will, addressing them.

WILL
Ms. Pillsbury’s agreed to take over
until the school can find a
permanent replacement.

MERCEDES
Is this ‘cause those Carmel kids
were so good? Because we can work
harder.

(MORE)

46.
47.

MERCEDES (CONT'D)
I’ve been coaching Rajeesh on his
rights and lefts, he almost has
them down.

RACHEL
This isn’t fair, Mr. Schuester --
we can’t do this without you.

Reveal Finn, his face and arms covered in faded green
blotches, remnants from his paintball attack that soap and a
good scrubbing could still not remove.

FINN
Does this mean I don’t have to be
in this club anymore?

Will is so moved, this is even harder than he thought it
would be. A beat as he thinks about what to say, then --

WILL

This isn’t about you guys. Being an
adult is about having to make
difficult choices. It’s not like
high school, sometimes you have to
give up the things that you love.
One day you guys are going to grow
up and understand that.

(then, with emotion)
IT have loved being your teacher.

This doesn’t matter to them -- all they understand is that

they’re losing the one person at this school who believed in
them -- and Will knows it.

With nothing more to say, Will walks down the aisle, leaving
their lives forever as we --

END ACT THREE

48.

ACT FOUR

INT. AUDITORIUM -- DAY

Emma sits at the piano, playing “Chopsticks.” The choir sings
along, bored.

EMMA
Good! One more time, guys.

RACHEL

We've been singing this for an
hour. We're warmed up.

A moment of hopelessness on Emma’s face, then admitting --

EMMA
Okay, it’s the only song I know how
to play.

MERCEDES

Ms. Pillsbury, you're a nice lady
and all, but you saw Vocal
Adrenaline, right?

RACHEL
I cannot carry this choir by
myself. We need to get Finn back.

MERCEDES
Oh, come on, Miley Cyrus. Are you
honestly surprised he didn’t stick
around?

EMMA
Guys, I know Glee Club has faced
some trying times this week. But
the most important thing is to not
give up.

RAJEESH
Why? Mr. Schuester did.

The moment resonates.
INT. HALLWAY -- DAY -- LATER

Finn retrieves a textbook from his locker. He slams it shut,
and Rachel is right there, startling him.

RACHEL
Didn’t see you at Glee Club today.
49,

FINN
Yeah, it conflicts with --

RACHEL
Your reputation?

FINN
Are you going to slap me again?
Just do it and get it over with.

RACHEL
Actually, I'm here to apologize for
that. I didn’t do it because I’m
jealous. I slapped you because I
knew you were going to do exactly
what you did -- quit Glee. It was a
pre-emptive slap.

Finn just stares, not understanding.

RACHEL (CONT’D)

You’ve really got something, Finn,
and you’re throwing it away.

(then)
It took years of discipline and
hard work to get people to look at
me. And all you have to do is roll
out of bed and people can’t take
their eyes off you.

(vulnerable)
I’d kill for that.

A herd of CHEERLEADERS pass, staring at them, wondering what
he’s doing even talking to an outcast like Rachel.

FINN
I’m gonna be late...

RACHEL
You can’t worry about what people
think of you, Finn. You're better
than all of them.

She gently squeezes his hand, then walks away. Off Finn --
INT. HW MENKEN -- DAY

Will, wearing a BLUE OXFORD, KHAKIS and a BLUE TIE walks
briskly with PETER, wearing the EXACT SAME THING. Peter is
giving Will his orientation as they hustle through the MAZE
of cubicles that make up the accounting floor. The cubicle
walls are SEVEN FEET HIGH, making it impossible to figure out
where you are or where you’ve come from.
50.

PETER
(handing passes to Will)
This is your parking pass, this is
your entry pass, this is your men’s
room pass.

Will looks the passes over, they all look the same.

PETER (CONT'D)
This is your lunch room pass --
you’‘re slotted for the three until
three-forty-five lunch shift.
Don’t bother trying to use it fora
different shift, it won't work and
they'll flag you. Three flags and
you lose a dessert ticket.

They come to an IMPASSE -- like rats in a maze.

PETER (CONT'D)
Crap.

Peter turns them around and they head back the way they came.

WILL
Isn’t three o'clock a little late
for lunch?

PETER
Lunch slots are divvied out
according to seniority. You move up
fifteen minutes every four point
two years.

Will does the math in his head -- he'd better bring a snack.
They arrive at a CUBICLE. It's gray, industrial. A
COMPUTER, a CHAIR and a DESK.

PETER (CONT'D)
Here we are. Feel free to decorate,
but don’t go too crazy.
(re: a huge stack of
files)
That‘’s your inbox.

Will enters, nods, tries to keep his head up. Peter, ina
rush, shakes his hand.

PETER (CONT’D)
By the way, if you hear a fire
alarm, ignore it, there’s no way
you‘d find the exit anyway.
51.

He leaves. Will turns on his computer, looks through the pile
of files -- spreadsheet after spreadsheet. He opens his
BRIEFCASE, takes SOMETHING out of it and PINS it to the wall.

It’s a photo of WILL AND TERRI, on their honeymoon at
UNIVERSAL CITY. He stares at it for a beat, remembers what
he’s doing this for and gets to work. After a few keystrokes
he hears something coming from the next cubicle. A muffled,
SNORTING sound. Curious, he rolls his chair over and stands
up on it so he can peek over the side.

He looks down into the other cubicle to see a MAN, a little
older than Will, working at the computer, QUIETLY SOBBING.

WILL
Hey, you okay?

The Man looks up at him with a THOUSAND YARD STARE, nods,
then goes back to his work. Will shrugs, then looks out at
the SEA of cubicles from above. They seem to go on FOREVER.

Suddenly, to his shock, he sees Emma at the end of the maze,
lost, clearly looking for someone.

WILL (CONT’D)
Emma?

She sees him, waves with relief.

WILL (CONT’D)
Follow the sound of my voice.

She smiles. He gets down off the chair, and she’s there in
his cubicle.

WILL (CONT'D)
This is a treat. What brings you
here?
(getting it)
Oh, right. Tax time.

EMMA
Actually, I'm here to see you,
Will. I made an appointment for you
-~ next Monday in my office at
three o’clock. You need some career
guidance.

WILL
Why? My career is finally on track.
The benefits package is amazing
here.
52.

EMMA
That’s great, Will, but just come --
for me?

He’s moved by her concern.

WILL
Fine, for you.

They share a smile -- they’ve missed each other.

EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD -- DAY

Finn and Puck, still in PRACTICE PADS, walk off the field.
Tanaka‘s prediction proved to be correct -- Finn has rejoined
the herd. But he’s a little hurt at what he was subjected to.

PUCK
What do you want me to do,
apologize? That’s not me, dude.

Finn ignores him.

PUCK (CONT’D)
Look, if I joined the Flag Team,
you'd beat the crap out of me. I
just don’t understand why you did
it.

FINN
Schuester told me he’d give me
enough extra credit to pass Spanish
if I joined the club -- I had no
choice. If I failed another class
I'd be off the team. But I quit,
okay? It’s over.

PUCK
Cool. And as a welcome back to the
world of the normal, I got you a
present.

They arrive at a LARGE, BLUE PORT-A-POTTY surrounded by the
JOCK GANG who threw Rajeesh into the dumpster. There’s a
rhythmic BANGING coming from inside the port-a-potty.

FINN
What’s that noise?

INT. PORT-A-POTTY -- CONTINUOUS

Arty is SLAMMING his wheelchair into the door in a vain
attempt to escape.
53.

EXT. PORT-A-POTTY -- CONTINUOUS

PUCK
We got that wheelchair kid inside,
we‘re gonna flip it.

FINN
Isn't that kind of dangerous?

PUCK
He’s already in a wheelchair. Come

on dude, we saved you the first
roll.

Everyone looks at Finn, waiting, laughing, expecting him to
follow through. Finn HESITATES as Arty continues his BANGING.
Is he going to do it? Then, after a few long beats, Finn goes
to the port-a-potty and OPENS THE DOOR. Arty wheels out,
grabs on to Finn’s arm.

ARTY

Thank you, thank you so much. Oh my
God, the smell...

PUCK
What the hell, dude? I can’t
believe you’re helping out this
loser.

FINN
Don’t you get it? We’re all losers.
Everyone in this school, hell
everyone in this town. No one has
any money, most of our parents are
divorced or hate each other. Only
half the kids who graduate ever go
toe college and maybe two leave the
state to do it. Our football team
is one and seven and the only win
we have is against that school for
the deaf.

Finn’s passion just roars out of him.

FINN (CONT’D)

You can haze other kids because
that‘s what your brothers did when
they were here, but someday you’re
going to end up just like them,
laid off, playing beer pong every
night and trying to score with high
school girls.
54.

Puck doesn’t understand what’s so bad about that, but
whatever.

FINN (CONT'D)

I‘m not afraid of being called a
loser because I can accept that
that’s what I am. I am afraid of
turning my back on something that
actually made me happy for the
first time in my sorry life.

A beat, then Finn pulls off his pads and THROWS them at Puck.

FINN (CONT'D)
Get yourself a new quarterback -- I
quit.

He turns and wheels a beaming Arty away. As they go, Arty
licks his finger, touches his ass and makes a SIZZLING SOUND.

Finn isn’t smiling, though, that was harder for him than it
looked. Then, he hears something. He looks to the other end
of the field and sees his mom’s ex DARREN standing beside his
CHEM-LAWN TRUCK, cigarette dangling from his mouth, hosing
down the field. There’s a new HOTTIE in the cab and
Journey's “Don’t Stop Believin’” is BLASTING from a BOOM BOX.

Finn takes the sounds in, remembers how much he loves the
music of that time, how it touches his SOUL. Then, as if

struck by a lightning bolt of INSPIRATION, he wheels Arty
away.

INT. AUDITORIUM -- CONTINUOUS
The club is rehearsing a dance move. There’s an argument.

RACHEL
I know what I’m talking about. I
won my first dance competition when
I was three months old.

Finn slams Arty through the doors, which fly open. They all
look at him. Then --

RAJEESH
This is a closed rehearsal.

FINN
Look, I owe you guys an apology. I
shouldn’t have quit.
MERCEDES
Whatever. I‘m about to quit. Take
my man to Ponderosa.

FINN
For too many years, I’ve been a
total douchebag. I don’t want to be
the guy who just drives around
throwing eggs at people.

RACHEL
That was you?

RAJEESH
You and your friends threw pee
balloons at me.

FINN
I know.

RAJEESH
You nailed all my lawn furniture to
my roof.

FINN

I wasn’t there for that, but I'm
really sorry.

(then)
Look, that isn’t who I am and I’m
tired of it. This is what I want to
be doing. With you guys. I used to
think that this was like the lamest
thing on earth. And maybe it is,
but...there’s a reason why we’re
all here.

They all look at him.

FINN (CONT‘D)
It’s because we all want to be good
at something.

They’re taken aback. Then:

FINN (CONT'D)
Arty, you play guitar, right? Think
you could recruit the jazz band?

ARTY
Sure.
56.

FINN
Mercedes. We need new costumes.
And they have to be cool. Can you

do that?
MERCEDES
DAMN, don’t you see what I got on?
FINN
Great. Rachel, you’re gonna
choreograph.

She smiles despite herself, thrilled to use her talents.

FINN (CONT'D)
Tina, what are you good at?

TINA
W-W-W-W-W-W-...

Awkwardness.

FINN
We’1l figure out something for you.

MERCEDES
What are you bringin’ to the table,
Justin Timberlake?

Finn‘s face lights up.

FINN
I’ve got the music.

INT. EMMA'S GUIDANCE OFFICE -- DAY

TIGHT on the sharpened tip of a NUMBER TWO PENCIL as it fills
in the BUBBLES of a standardized test.

WILL
I think I’m a little old to be
taking a “Career Guidance Test.”

EMMA
You’re almost done.

Will finishes, hands the test to Emma. She smiles, primly
starts to tally the score.
EMMA (CONT'D)

Each one of your responses has a
number value and when I add them
all up, it will tell us what your
ideal career should be.

(some more score keeping,

then)
Four-eighty-three.

She takes out a KEY and works her way down to find Will’s
number. TIGHT ON her finger, moving down the sheet, past
career possibilities like CLERK, NEUROSURGEON, BALLET DANCER
until she arrives at 483 -- RODEO CLOWN. She’s shocked.

WILL
(excited)
What‘s it say?

Emma takes a beat, files the test away. Then --

EMMA
T‘/1l tell you what it doesn’t say --
best suited to cubicle dweller.

WILL
Look, Emma, this is very sweet of
you, and I’1l admit that my new
line of work isn’t as challenging
as I'd like it to be, but it’s the
right move for my family.

EMMA
I want to show you something.

She grabs a VIDEOCASSETTE from her desk, puts it in the VCR.

EMMA (CONT’D)
I was researching past Glee teams
for the kids, thought maybe I could
steal some moves. This is a tape
they had in the library of the ‘93
team at Nationals in Epcot.

The GRAINY IMAGE begins to play on the screen.

After a few

seconds she PAUSES the tape, just as the camera catches a
CLOSE UP of a JOYFUL young BOY, his mouth open in mid-song
(we should remember this featured face from the opening).

EMMA (CONT’D)
Do you know who that is?

Will just stares with quiet emotion -- this is hard for him.
58.

EMMA (CONT'D)
It's you, Will -- happier than I’ve
ever seen you.

WILL
(softly)
That was the greatest moment of my
life.

EMMA
Why?

WILL
Because I loved what I was doing.
You don‘t get to be great at
something every day. I knew before
we were half-way through with that
number that we were going to win.
Being a part of that, in that
moment...I knew who I was in the
world.

EMMA
Was it a guy in a tie who bragged
about his benefits program?

WILL
No -- but the only time I’ve felt
that way since then was when Terri
told me I was going to be a father.
(then)
I need to provide for my family.

EMMA
Provide what? The understanding
that nothing is more important than
money? Or the idea that the only
life worth living is one that
you’re passionate about?

That hits Will right where he lives. PUSH IN on his face as
the first notes of a Glee Club VERSION of “Don’t Stop
Believin’” begins to play...

INT. HALLWAY -- DAY

Will walks down the hallway, passing the auditorium. He
hears singing. He pauses, then sneaks in the door. New
Directions is on stage in new costumes, cute cut-up tops over
torn jeans and Chuck Taylors. Finn and Rachel sing a capella
in front of the choir, who hums a simple harmony.
59.

FINN
“JUST A SMALL TOWN GIRL/ LIVING IN
A LONELY WORLD.../ SHE TOOK THE
MIDNIGHT TRAIN GOING ANYWHERE...”

RACHEL
“JUST A CITY BOY/ BORN AND RAISED
IN SOUTH DETROIT.../ HE TOOK THE
MIDNIGHT TRAIN GOING ANYWHERE..."

It's JOURNEY. And it’s incredibly emotional...because the
kids are really FEELING it. Arty wails a sick guitar lick,
and the JAZZ BAND surges in. The choir starts to dance behind
them. They look and sound really different...what they lack
in expertise they make up for in sweet youthful enthusiasm.
Everyone starts to sing:

EVERYONE
“WORKING HARD TO GET MY FILL/
EVERYBODY WANTS A THRILL.../
PLAYING ANYTHING TO ROLL THE DICE
JUST ONE MORE TIME..."

PUSH IN on Will, unseen in the back of the theatre,
overwhelmed by what he’s seeing. For a moment he can’t move,
then turns and hurries back out. “Don't Stop Believin’”
continues under:

INT. SCHUESTER APARTMENT -- DAY -- LATER

Will rushes in, out of breath. Terri sits at the table idly
eating pickles.

WILL

I’m going back.
(off her look)

I'm a teacher. You want me to
fulfill my promise? This is how I'm
gonna do it. I‘ll figure out the
money, get a part-time job on the
weekends to pull us through if I
have to.

She is stunned.

WILL (CONT’D)
What would you rather have, Terri?
A kid with a pony, or a kid with a
father who’s proud of what he does
for a living? This is my passion. I
have to do this.

(then)
(MORE)
60.

WILL (CONT’D)
And I don’t want to hear anymore
about how we don’t have joy in our
lives. That's something we have to
open ourselves up to, every day.

She slowly stands, then exits to the bedroom. She comes back,
and smoothly hands him a BLANKET and A PILLOW.

WILL (CONT’D)
What’s this for?

TERRI
The couch. It gets cold out here at
night.

She exits, closes the bedroom door. Off Will, realizing there
will be repercussions for living up to his potential --

INT. AUDITORIUM -- DAYS LATER

The New Directions have found their groove as they continue
practicing “Don’t Stop Believin’.” The jazz band sinks their
teeth into the chorus, and the choir sings in a piercing
seven-part harmony. Even Tina has found a place here -- she’s
a HUMAN BEAT BOX.

As they move through their positions, they share looks across
the stage, laughs and smiles between them, breathless,
sweating...they’re on fire.

EVERYONE
“DON'T STOP BELIEVING...HOLD ON TO
THAT FE-E-E-ELING...STRE~E-ET
LIFE...PE-E-OPLE...”

Finn and Rachel share a look that hints of something to come.

EVERYONE (CONT'D)
“DON'T STOP BELIEVING... HOLD ON TO
THAT FE-E-ELING! DON’T STOP!!!"

They hit their final position, hold it, panting through
ecstatic smiles. The camera PULLS OUT to find Will and Emma,
glowing, standing in the audience.

WILL
Good, guys. It’s a 9, we need a 10.
Finn, I think if we worked on it,
you could hit a high E. Rachel,
easy on the jazzhands and let’s try
to get those bangs out of your
face. Mercedes, sometimes when you
sing, it looks like you’re in pain.
61.

MERCEDES
‘Cuz it HURTS to be this good.

They all smile. Then, overwhelmed with pride and potential:

WILL
From the top.

END PILOT
