VOICES. Millions of them, all at once. Hushed conversations;
panicked calls to 911; pleas for help. Over SURVEILLANCE
FOOTAGE. Hundreds of shots, rapid fire. Two stand out:

-- LOW-RISE APARTMENTS: Four MASKED MEN burst into the ground
floor apartment. They force the men inside to the floor,
then GUNSHOTS. The armed men leave, carrying two bags.

-- TRAFFIC CAMERA: A station wagon pulls to the side of a
deserted stretch of highway. A MAN climbs out, pulls open
the trunk, and pulls out a WOMAN'S BODY. He drags the body
to the passenger seat.

After a few seconds, each shot is marked with a title --
'NON-RELEVANT TO INVESTIGATION'. As we pick up a final shot
of the Brooklyn Bridge, one voice emerges from the noise:

                       REESE (V.O.)
           You want the truth? At the end,
           we're all alone...

EXT.   BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT

A solitary FIGURE walks to the guardrail, then climbs up
onto the handrail. One foot, then another. He's going to
jump. We're waiting for the cut. But the shot lingers...

The shot dissolves from low-res, and we're there, with this
crazy asshole, teetering two hundred feet over the water.
He's homeless, in a filthy coat, but it's taking the balance
of an athlete for him to stand up there. He pulls out a
pint bottle. Finishes it off. Drops it. Watches it hurtle
towards the void below.

                       REESE (V.O.)
           No one cares. No one's keeping score.
           No one is coming to save you...

Suddenly a finger of light appears a mile down the East River.
He watches as it travels upwards, then explodes in color.
Then another. Fireworks. It's the Fourth of July.

The man shakes his head. Disbelief. One charming, broken
laugh as he climbs back down from the rail and walks back
towards the city. This is REESE.

EXT.   NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

4 AM: end of the line. Surveillance cameras pick up a group
of well dressed TOUGH GUYS making their way out of a trendy
night spot, bouncers deferential. They're arranged around
ANTON, 21, fuckup son of one of the city's Mafia lieutenants.

Anton lights a firecracker. Throws it at the feet of a
passing COUPLE. BANG. The couple hurry on, freaked.
                                                              2.

A Range Rover pulls up.   Anton looks unhappy.

                        ANTON
            No one lets me have any fun anymore.
            I'm taking the train home.

He walks.   His entourage shrugs, then follows.

INT.   SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT

Anton and his friends climb onto the train. Anton lights a
firecracker. Drops it. BANG. A small group of GANGBANGERS
take offense. One of them flashes a gun tucked into his
pants. Anton looks unimpressed.

                        ANTON
            That come in a cereal box?   You wanna
            see a real gun?

The gangbangers back off, survival instinct kicking in.
They get off at the next stop.

                        ANTON (CONT'D)
            City's getting dangerous. Everyone's
            packing now. That's why we're picking
            up some new hardware next week.

Anton tries to light another firecracker, hands clumsy from
booze. The handful of passengers move a tactical distance
away. All but one. Slumped on a plastic bench: Reese.

Anton shushes his friends. Finally gets the firecracker
lit. Creeps over to Reese. Suppressing a giggle, he starts
to slide the firecracker into the pocket of Reese's jacket.
Suddenly, Reese's hand moves. Lightning fast. Closes like
a vise around Anton's hand and the firecracker. Reese opens
his eyes. Stares up at Anton. The fuse is burning down
between their fingers. This is going to hurt...

At the last second, Reese pinches out the fuse. Anton
stumbles back, clutching at his singed paw, furious.

                        ANTON (CONT'D)
            You're a dead man.

                        REESE
            Tell me about it.

Reese slides back in the chair. Pulls his hat low to sleep.
Anton and his crew, thrilled to have someone to fight, square
off. Reese, weary, looks up at them.

                                                        CUT TO:
                                                                   3.

INT. BULLPEN, NINTH PRECINCT - NIGHT

CARTER, 30s, smart, pretty -- and tough as a box of nails
left out in the rain. She's interviewing a WOMAN with an
ugly bruise on her eye.

                       CARTER
           I work homicide, Mrs. Kovach. I'm
           the one who has to investigate it
           when your husband finally beats you
           to death. Understand? And every
           time you tell us it was an accident,
           you're strengthening the story he's
           going to use to get out of it. That
           you were clumsy. Accident-prone.

Carter lets it sink in. The woman stares back at her.        For
a second she's ready to talk. Then it's gone.

                         MRS. KOVACH
           Stairs.    I fell down the stairs.

Carter gives up.     Another DETECTIVE laughs as the woman
leaves.

                       DETECTIVE
           Don't know why you bother, Carter.
           Can't save 'em all.

Carter ignores him.    A TRANSIT COP enters, looking for her.

                       TRANSIT COP
           Detective Carter? We pulled in that
           kid Anton you liked for the homeless
           guy beaten to death last year. We
           caught him working over another one.
           Figured maybe you could take it to
           the DA.

INT.   HOLDING, NINTH PRECINCT - NIGHT

Carter follows the transit cop down to the floor. Spots
Anton and his pals cuffed to a bench, looking worse for the
wear. Bruised and beaten. Anton blows her a kiss.

                       CARTER
           I'll need a statement from the bum.
           Which hospital did they take him to?

The transit cop shakes his head. Points. Over in the corner,
holding an ice pack to his head -- Reese. Barely dinged up.
Looking a lot better than Anton and his friends, in fact.

                       TRANSIT COP
           We got video on it, though.
                                                             4.

The uniform cop opens a laptop. Cues up the tape. Carter
watches it, absorbed. Looks back up at the homeless guy,
intrigued. Turns back to the transit cop.

                      CARTER
          Anton'll keep. I wanna talk to him.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, NINTH PRECINCT - NIGHT

Reese holds the ice pack against his head. Carter walks in,
holding a fresh one, trades Reese for the old one.

                      CARTER
          You coulda done me a favor. Let
          those guys land a few more punches.

                      REESE
          I'll bear that in mind next time.

Carter cues the video on the laptop. Advances it to the
point where Anton hauls Reese up to his feet.

                      CARTER
          Question for you... How'd you know
          this guy was the one with the gun?
              (off his look)
          Anton's dumb, but not dumb enough to
          carry in public. But one of his
          crew is always carrying. Five guys.
          One gun. And you break that guy's
          arm. Before he can reach his weapon.

She rolls the tape. Anton and his crew all try to punch
Reese at once. Reese grabs one of the men seemingly at
random, then SNAPS his arm with incredible power and speed
as the man reaches for the gun in his waistband. He dodges
a few more punches with remarkable agility. Carter stops
the tape. Reese shrugs. Smiles.

                      REESE
          Lucky, I guess.

                        CARTER
          I'm Carter.    You didn't give us a
          name.

                      REESE
          You know what's funny? Best parts
          of your life you don't need a name.
          You get to be dad, sweetheart, pal.
          Seems like the only time you need a
          name is when you're in trouble. Am
          I in trouble?
                                                             5.

                      CARTER
          You tell me. You're the one living
          on the street. Looking at this tape
          I'd think you were in the service,
          right?
              (beat)
          Because I was. Army. Two tours in
          Iraq. But you don't learn to fight
          like that in the regular army. What
          were you? Special Forces? Delta?

                      REESE
          They got classes down at the YMCA.

                      CARTER
          It can be difficult making that
          transition back. Some guys I knew
          got a little lost. That disconnect
          between the things they'd been trained
          to do and the things they were
          expected to do when they got home.
          Some of them needed a little help
          with the adjustment. Turn it into a
          project. You need some help?

                      REESE
          Maybe you could help me find the
          phone number for my stockbroker?   I
          seem to have misplaced it.

                      CARTER
          Of course, some guys fell apart
          because they'd done so many evil
          things that they felt like they needed
          a little punishment.

She cues the tape again. Lets it play. At a certain point,
it's as if Reese gives up. Lets himself catch a couple of
punches. The transit cops climb on and break it up.

                      CARTER (CONT'D)
          Is that your story... pal?

Reese doesn't answer. Maybe Carter's hit a nerve.   Or maybe
Reese is just bored. Carter stands.

INT. HOLDING, NINTH PRECINCT - NIGHT

Carter walks outside. Carefully bags the ice pack she took
from Reese. Catches the attention of the uniform cop.

                      CARTER
          Hold Anton till morning. Then cut
          him loose. DA won't reopen for this.

                                                               6.

                       CARTER (CONT'D)
           But don't let the homeless guy go
           till I can run his prints. I got a
           feeling about this guy.

INT.   FORENSICS, NINTH PRECINCT - NIGHT

Carter waits as a TECH lifts prints off the ice pack, then
scans it into his computer and pings the national database.

INT.   OPERATIONS DIVISION, CIA HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

An ANALYST picks up a phone as his terminal ALERTS him of
the pending search. Dials a number. Listens. Then, with a
button press, authorizes the search to proceed.

INT.   DARKENED ROOM - NIGHT

An alert flashes on a monitor.   A hand reaches for a phone.

INT. HOLDING, NINTH PRECINCT - NIGHT

The transit cop looks up as a LAWYER in a five-figure suit
walks in. Anton looks up, hopeful. But the lawyer ignores
him and points to Reese.

INT. FORENSICS, NINTH PRECINCT - NIGHT

Carter scans the board of mugshots, always working.    The
tech WHISTLES and calls her back over.

                       TECH
           Wow. Wow wow. This guy was held
           for questioning a dozen times in the
           last ten years. No name given. No
           charges filed. No explanation. For
           a homeless guy he gets around; he's
           got open warrants in four different
           countries. Most recent prints logged
           right here: Businessman named Arndt
           beaten to death in New Rochelle in
           May. Who've you got down there,
           Carter? The angel of death?

Carter looks at the printout.    Even she's stunned.

INT. HOLDING, NINTH PRECINCT - NIGHT

Carter heads down the stairs. Clocks the empty holding cell.
Turns back to the desk sergeant, frantic.

EXT.   NINTH PRECINCT - NIGHT

The lawyer guides Reese down the steps of the station house.
                                                           7.

                       REESE
           I appreciate the help, counselor.
           Who's picking up the tab?

The lawyer ignores him, leaving Reese at the corner, where a
town car is double parked. Two PRIVATE SECURITY MEN are
waiting, making it clear that they want Reese to get in.

                       PRIVATE SECURITY
           Our employer wants a word with you.

Reese weighs his options. A block back, Carter pushes through
the front doors of the station, hunting for him. Reese
shrugs. Climbs into the back of the car.

EXT.   STREETS, MANHATTAN - NIGHT

The car speeds through Manhattan. The city is slowly coming
alive, like a toy being wound up, about to let spin.

                       REESE
           I'm a little tired, fellas. Maybe
           another time. You can just drop me-

The security guys respond by locking the doors with a THUNK.

EXT.   TOP LEVEL, PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT

The car stops and Reese climbs out. A man is waiting for
him, staring out over the city. This is FINCH, 50s, rumpled
suit, haunted eyes, body stiff from some old, deep wounds.

                       REESE
           Do I owe you money? Because I'm
           running a little short at the moment.

                       FINCH
           You don't owe me anything, Mr. Reese.
           That's the name you prefer, isn't
           it? I know you've had... several.

Reese reacts at the mention of his name.

                       FINCH (CONT'D)
           Don't worry. I'm not going to tell
           anyone about you.

                       REESE
           You don't know anything about me.

                       FINCH
           I know exactly everything about you,
           Mr. Reese. I know about the work
           you used to do for the government.
                       (MORE)
                                                             8.

                      FINCH (CONT'D)
          I know about the... doubts you came
          to have about that work. I know the
          government, along with everyone else,
          thinks you're dead -- a star on the
          wall at CIA headquarters in Langley.

At this last comment, Reese steps closer to Finch, anger
rising. Finch's security respond, until he waves them off.

                      FINCH (CONT'D)
          I know you've spent the last two
          months trying to drink yourself to
          death. And I know you're considering
          more efficient ways to do it. Which
          would be a shame. You see --
          knowledge is not my problem. Doing
          something with that knowledge is
          where I'm... lacking. That's where
          you would come in.

                      REESE
          I'm not sure I follow.

                      FINCH
          I think we could help each other.
          You see, Mr. Reese, I don't think
          you need a psychiatrist. Or a support
          group. Or pills.

                       REESE
          Yeah?   What do I need?

                      FINCH
          You need a purpose. More
          specifically, you need a job.

Reese LAUGHS.   Is he serious?

                      REESE
          What kind of job?

                      FINCH
          It's a little unconventional, and
          it'll take a little while to explain.
          Of course I'll pay you for your time.
          I know you don't care about the money.
          But if you're going to drink yourself
          to death, you could at least do it
          with a higher grade of alcohol.

One of Finch's security holds out a wad of hundreds. Gestures
back towards the car. Reese thinks it over, then takes the
money and climbs into the car. The knife edge of the sun is
rising over the East River.
                                                             9.

EXT. STREETS, MANHATTAN - DAY

The car glides through the morning rush hour of Manhattan.
At each stop light, people stream around the car. Millions
of them, all heading in different directions.

                      FINCH
          8 million people. You know what
          they all have in common? None of
          them know what happens next.
              (beat)
          Good things, maybe. But for some of
          these people, very bad things are on
          the way. Someone is murdered in New
          York every 18 hours. Did you know
          that? It's like musical chairs. At
          the end of the day, one of these
          people will be gone.

                      REESE
          Bad things happen to people every
          day. You can't stop that.

                      FINCH
          But what if you could? Not all of
          them; not the ones that happen in
          the heat of the moment. But some of
          these crimes are planned for days or
          weeks in advance. What if you could
          stop those ones?

                      REESE
          Is this like a psychic thing?

                       FINCH
              (laughs)
          No psychics. No magic. You see,
          when I was a kid, I wanted a jet
          pack. A summer house on Mars. And
          then I realized I was growing up in
          the information age. And that was a
          shocking disappointment to me. Until
          I realized how important that was.
          How revolutionary.
              (beat)
          The right person, in the right place,
          with the right information, can change
          everything.

Finch steps out of the car and into the swirl of people around
them, morning commuters on their way to work. Reese follows.

EXT. STREETS, LOWER MANHATTAN - DAY

Finch stands on the street corner, people racing past him.
                                                            10.

                      FINCH
          My problem, Mr. Reese, is that I
          have a list. A list of people who
          are about to be involved in very bad
          situations.

                      REESE
          Where did you get this list?

                      FINCH
          I can't tell you that.

                      REESE
          If I don't know how you got the
          information, how am I supposed to
          know it's accurate?

                      FINCH
          You'll have to do something which
          doesn't come very naturally to you.
          You'll have to trust me.

                      REESE
          The people on this list.   Who are
          they?

                      FINCH
          Just ordinary people, going about
          their lives. Some of them may have
          no idea what is about to happen.

                      REESE
          Like who?

                      FINCH
          Like her.

Finch nods towards the sidewalk. Reese follows his gaze.
There, on the corner, waiting in line for a coffee from a
vendor, is a WOMAN, 30s, pretty, suit.

                      FINCH (CONT'D)
          Her name is Diane Bray. And this
          week, she's on the top of my list.

                      REESE
          This woman? You think something bad
          is going to happen involving her?

                      FINCH
          No. Mr. Reese. I know something
          bad is going to happen.
                                                           11.

                       REESE
           So you want me to play bodyguard to
           this woman?

                       FINCH
           It's not that simple. I don't know
           exactly what's about to happen. Or
           what her role in it is. She could
           be the victim. She could be the
           perpetrator. All I know is that
           she'll be involved. I want you to
           follow her. Figure out what's about
           to happen. And then stop it from
           happening.

Reese watches the woman disappear into the crowd.

                       REESE
           Why not just call the police?

                       FINCH
           If anyone found out   I had access to
           this list, it would   be... problematic.
           You would name your   own salary.
           Expenses. Whatever    you need.

                       REESE
           What do you get out of it?

                       FINCH
           I'm a very private person, Mr. Reese.
           Your job would be to investigate the
           people on the list. Not me.
               (beat)
           What do you think?

Reese hesitates.   Looks at Finch.   Decides.

                       REESE
           I think you're a bored rich guy with
           an agenda. And I think I'm done.

Reese turns back. Starts to walk away. One of the security
men reaches for him. Big mistake. Reese wrenches his arm.
Pushes him back, using the man's head to BUTT the other
security man in the face. It's brutal and fast.

When Finch turns back from his men, Reese is gone.

INT.   SHITHOLE MOTEL NEAR JFK - NIGHT

Reese counts off twenties.   The cashier watches from behind
bullet-proof glass.
                                                           12.

                       CASHIER
           Name? City says I gotta see ID.
           Something with a picture on it.

Reese slaps a hundred dollar bill to the glass.   The cashier
eyes it greedily. Jots a name in his book.

                       CASHIER (CONT'D)
           Mr... Franklin.

INT.   ROOM, SHITHOLE MOTEL - NIGHT

TV's tuned to local news. Lead story is a crude sketch of a
homeless guy with a beard -- Reese. 'Police seek suspect.'
Reese watches from the bathroom, shaving.

Later: Reese, clean-shaven, flops on the bed drinking rye
from a pint bottle. Falls asleep watching a samurai movie.

BLACK. A phone RINGS. Reese opens his eyes, groggy. The
TV's off, but it's a flat screen. This isn't the same room...

INT.   ROOM, LUXURY HOTEL - NIGHT

Reese tries to sit up. He can't: his left hand is zip-tied
to the padded headboard, which is bolted to the wall. The
phone is still RINGING. He strains to reach it with his
free hand. Answers.

                       FINCH (V.O.)
           You need to understand, Mr. Reese.
           The information I have is incomplete --
           but it's never wrong.
               (beat)
           A woman is going to be murdered in
           the room next to yours in five
           minutes. Unless you do something.

The line clicks. Dead. Reese stares at it. Then yanks at
the ziptie binding his wrist. Suddenly he hears a THUMP as
the door in the room next to his opens. He pulls himself up
to the wall. Presses his ear against it.

MUFFLED SOUNDS: a phone RINGING. A woman ANSWERS. Her voice
is indistinct. Then a KNOCK. Reese yanks at the ziptie
binding his hand. Hears FOOTSTEPS heading towards the door.
A THUD as someone hits the ground. MUFFLED SCREAMS.

FLASHES -- we see a WOMAN'S face, a fist SMASHING DOWN.   Is
this Reese imagining or remembering?

Reese strains, the ziptie cutting into his wrist. He KICKS
at the wall. SOUNDS of violence from the next room -- she's
fighting back. Reese picks up the lamp. Hurls it at the
mirror above the dresser, which DISINTEGRATES.
                                                             13.

He picks up a piece of broken mirror. Hacks off the ziptie.
Rips open the door to the adjoining room. Another door backs
against it, locked from the other side. Reese backs up.
Hurls himself bodily through it and into...

INT.   NEIGHBORING ROOM, LUXURY HOTEL - NIGHT

Reese pulls himself up, grasping the broken piece of mirror
in his bloodied hand, ready to intervene. He scans the room.

It's empty. Except for Finch. Sitting in a chair in the
corner of the room. The woman BEGS for her life over the
speaker of a reel-to-reel tape deck. Finch shuts it off.

                       FINCH
           You're too late. Like you were too
           late for your friend in New Rochelle.

Reese grabs Finch, eyes flashing with an animal rage.   He
looks like he's going to put Finch through the wall.

                       REESE
           What the hell do you know about it?

                       FINCH
           It's the truth. And that's what I'm
           offering you, Mr. Reese. Trust.
           You left the government because they
           betrayed that trust. Because they
           lied to you. I never will. You
           couldn't have saved your friend. Or
           this woman -- this recording is three
           years old. But you could have saved
           them, if you'd known in time.
               (beat)
           Because that's the other thing I'm
           offering. The chance to be there in
           time. It's not too late for Diane
           Bray. You could help me stop
           whatever's coming for her.

Reese lets go of Finch. Stumbles back and collapses against
the wall, spent. Looks back up at Finch.

                       FINCH (CONT'D)
           The question is, are you going to?

Off Reese's face, considering... we CUE TITLES:

                   'PERSON OF INTEREST'
                                                           14.

                         ACT ONE

EXT. STREET, MIDTOWN - DAY

Surveillance footage.   Commuters stream down Second Avenue.
One man doesn't move:   Reese.

Reese watches as Bray, the woman Finch pointed out earlier,
steps out of her apartment building across the street. Reese
starts to tail her at a healthy distance. Listens to Finch
via an earpiece.

                      FINCH (V.O.)
          Diane Bray. Grew up in Trenton.
          Moved back to the city after law
          school. Was engaged for a few months
          but broke it off.

                      REESE
          Anybody she's come into contact with
          who might be holding a grudge?

                      FINCH (V.O.)
          One or two... Ms. Bray is an
          assistant district attorney. Best
          conviction rate in her department.
          She's put away hundreds of felons;
          murderers, armed robbers.

As Reese watches, Bray walks into the offices of the New
York County District Attorney.

                      REESE
          Great. Nice short list of possible
          suspects. And we have no idea what
          time frame we're working with?

                      FINCH (V.O.)
          Could be next week. Tomorrow.    Or
          five minutes from now.

Reese looks at the ARMED GUARDS at the entrance to the
District Attorney's office.

                      REESE
          Then I'm going to need to know
          everything I can about her.

                      FINCH (V.O.)
          And how do you go about that?

                      REESE
          The slow way is to cultivate a
          friendship over weeks or months,

           engineering situations that allow
           you to earn the asset's trust.

                       FINCH (V.O.)
           And the fast way?

INT.   HALLWAY, APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Reese looks up and down the hallway.      Then starts picking
the locks on one of the doors.

                       REESE (V.O.)
           Break into their home and go through
           all their stuff.

INT.   LIVING ROOM, BRAY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Reese lets himself in.    Gently closes the door behind him.
Begins looking around.    Keys the headset on his phone.

                       REESE
           I'm in. You're sure this isn't some
           ex-girlfriend of yours?

                         FINCH (V.O.)
           Quite sure.

Reese moves to the desktop computer. Sits down.       Taps a
key. The login is password protected.

Reese holds a function key on the keyboard and reboots the
machine into safe mode. While he's waiting he pulls open
the desk drawer. Finds a half-eaten roll of antacid tablets.

The machine reboots. He re-assigns the administrator password
then opens Windows. Pulls up her browser, email client and
recent documents folder. Plugs in a thumb drive and begins
dumping everything onto it while he chews an antacid.

INT.   BATHROOM, BRAY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Reese opens the medicine cabinet.       Rifles through it.

INT.   LIVING ROOM, BRAY'S APARTMENT - DAY

The thumb drive is done. Reese unplugs it. Steps to the
window. Looks out at the building across the street.

EXT. NEW YORK CRIMINAL COURT - DAY

Reese stands on the street corner, eating falafel and talking
to Finch on the phone.
                                                           16.

                       REESE
           Bray's taking ulcer medication. And
           sleeping pills. She's scared of
           something.

Bray walks past.   Reese dumps his meal and follows her.

INT.   LOBBY, COURTHOUSE - DAY

Reese follows Bray up the stairs and into the line for
security. She's checking her smartphone. He pulls out his.
Pulls up a decidedly non-legal app which scans for Bluetooth
signals. Picks Bray's phone out of the list. Presses a
button labelled 'Force Pair.' When it's complete, he presses
a button labelled 'install .exe.' A bar begins to fill on
the screen of Reese's phone as it hacks into Bray's phone.

Bray sets her phone down in a tray to go through the metal
detector. Reese does likewise. The two phones travel into
the detector together.

On the far side, Bray picks up her phone and heads into court.
Reese checks his phone. The installation is complete.

INT.   COURTROOM - DAY

Reese slips inside. Takes a seat in the back of the court.
Pulls up Bray's emails on his phone and begins reading them.
Bray is questioning a stocky homicide detective, FUSCO, 40s.

                       BRAY
           Describe the scene when you found
           it, Detective Fusco.

                       FUSCO
           It was... colorful. Five dead. The
           last one who was shot, Terrence Salt,
           had managed to crawl to a phone ten
           feet from where this dope-slinging
           piece of trash shot him.

Fusco looks at the defendant, POPE, 30s, 250 lbs of pissed
off gangster. His court-appointed lawyer stands, indignant.

                       FUSCO (CONT'D)
           Sorry. Ten feet from where this
           piece of dope-slinging trash allegedly
           shot him.

Pope leans back in his chair, eyes hooded, unreadable.

                       BRAY
           And based on the testimony and
           evidence you collected, what do you
           believe happened?
                                                            17.

                      FUSCO
          We think Pope knew a drug deal was
          going down between some of his own
          so-called friends and their mob
          suppliers. Looks like he recruited
          a couple shooters, interrupted the
          deal, killed everyone, and took the
          money and the drugs. Amazingly, it
          turns out, career criminals do not
          make very trustworthy friends.

Some LAUGHTER from the back of the room. Bray returns to
the table, where her colleague, MILLER, 40s, wrinkled suit,
another ADA, is flagging her down with a note.

Bray reads the note, then has a hushed argument with Miller
before returning to questioning. Reese watches, interested.

EXT. ROOFTOP, MIDTOWN - NIGHT

Reese sets up a camera on the edge of the roof. Points it at
the apartment across the street. Zooms and racks focus.

CAMERA P.O.V. -- Bray comes into view, pacing between her
case files and Chinese takeout, talking on her landline.

Reese pulls out his smartphone. Turns on a program called
'Open mic.' Suddenly he's listening to Bray's apartment
through the mic on her cell phone, which is lying on the
kitchen table. We can hear her side of the conversation,
but it grows louder and softer as she paces back and forth.

                      BRAY (V.O.)
          I can't make it out this weekend.
          Maybe next month.
              (beat)
          I know you worry. I'm fine, Dad.
          Yes. It's a tough job. But I can
          look out for myself. You know that.

Reese looks down as his phone vibrates with a text: '150 W.
Bemis Street. 20 Minutes.'

INT. DERELICT LIBRARY - NIGHT

Reese follows Finch through the musty stacks of an abandoned
city library. Finch leads them to a maintenance door in the
back of the library with a shiny new deadbolt.

                      REESE
          What is this place?

Finch unlocks the door and ushers Reese inside.
                                                             18.

INT.   CONTROL, DERELICT LIBRARY - NIGHT

Reese steps through an armored door and into a room filled
with equipment: monitors, racks of listening devices,
electronics, surveillance and hacking gear.

                       FINCH
           The decline of Western civilization.
           The city closed half of its libraries --
           budget issues. But for our purposes,
           it's a space that can't be traced to
           either of us. The city sold it to a
           bank I control that promptly declared
           bankruptcy. The property is in limbo:
           it doesn't exist.

                       REESE
           Neither do you. I did a little
           looking.

Finch ignores him.   Points to documents laid out on a table.

                       FINCH
           Driver's licenses. Credit cards.
           Six different cover identities, all
           backed up with small online footprints
           that update automatically. Funds
           will be replenished through a proxy
           company. Similar to the arrangements
           when you were working for the agency.

                       REESE
           When I worked for the agency I knew
           who was picking up the tab.

                       FINCH
           I recognize, Mr. Reese, that there
           is a disparity between how much I
           know about you and how much you know
           about me. I also know you'll be
           trying to close that gap as quickly
           as possible. But you need to
           understand that I'm a very private
           person.
               (beat)
           Now what have you found?

Reese moves to a computer. Types an IP address into a
browser. The surveillance footage of Bray comes up. He
pulls out his smartphone. Suddenly the room fills with the
sound of Bray's apartment.

                       REESE
           I've got picture.

          And sound through her phone. The
          phone's got GPS, so we can also use
          it to track her movements. I went
          through her bank statements, credit
          card bills. She's squeaky clean.
          Student loans were forgiven when she
          joined the DA. No debts. No
          attachments. So, assuming she's the
          target, I'm going to start going
          through her work email and case files,
          looking for anyone who stands out.

Reese plugs the thumb drive into the computer. Finch looks
over the documents he's pulled off of Bray's computer. Reese
looks over the equipment laid out in bins around the space.
On the wall in the back of the room he spots something:

The wall is covered in a tangle of pictures and newspaper
clippings. At the center of the mess is a list: sets of
nine digit numbers, with lines radiating out, connecting
each set of numbers to a newspaper clipping or printout.
Reese studies it, fascinated.

                      REESE (CONT'D)
          This is your list. The list. But
          you don't get names, do you? These
          are Social Security numbers.

Finch looks at him, mute. Expressionless. Reese looks back
at the list. Reese follows the connections to the newspaper
clippings.

                       REESE (CONT'D)
          And each of them map out to a murder,
          or a kidnapping. All of these numbers
          represent...

                       FINCH
          Yes.   Lost chances.

Reese turns back to Finch, losing patience with him.

                      REESE
          I could be a lot more help if you'd
          tell me where you're getting these
          numbers.

                      FINCH
          It doesn't make any difference where
          I get them. Right now all you need
          to know is that the next number that's
          up is hers.

He points to Bray's picture on the screen.
                                                             20.

                       REESE
           Trust works both ways, Finch. If
           telling me would put you at some
           kind of risk-

                       FINCH
           It would put a lot more people than
           just me at risk.
               (beat)
           And I think you'll agree trusting an
           alcoholic ex-government hit man is a
           little more challenging than trusting
           a middle-aged cripple.

Finch moves slowly to the door, putting on his coat.

                       FINCH (CONT'D)
           If you don't mind, I'm going to leave
           you to it.

Finch leaves.   Reese gives him thirty seconds.    Then follows.

EXT.   STREETS, UPPER MANHATTAN - NIGHT

Reese follows Finch at a distance. As he watches, Finch's
security team drop seamlessly into place, tailing Finch at a
careful distance. Finch turns a corner onto a quieter block.

Reese waits, then follows. But the block is empty. Finch
is gone. Reese's phone rings. He answers, smiling.

                       FINCH (V.O.)
           I told you, Reese. I'm a private
           person.

Reese looks up and down the empty street, impressed.

                       FINCH (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           I've got one more address for you to
           check out tonight.

EXT. STREETS, LOWER MANHATTAN - NIGHT

Reese walks a darkened line of industrial buildings.    Stops
at the address Finch has given him.

INT. HALLWAY, INDUSTRIAL BUILDING - NIGHT

Reese counts the doors. Finch is in his earpiece, guiding
him to the right one. Reese kneels, checks the hallway.
Starts working the lock.
                                                          21.

INT. MASSIVE LOFT, DOWNTOWN - NIGHT

The door pops open. Reese slips inside. The apartment is
modern, simple, and dimly lit, showing off floor to ceiling
views of Manhattan.

                       REESE
           What am I doing here?

                        FINCH (V.O.)
           Sleeping.   We'll have plenty to do
           tomorrow.

                       REESE
           What are you talking about?     Who
           lives here?

                       FINCH (V.O.)
           You do, Mr. Reese.

Reese looks around at the massive space.

SURVEILLANCE POV -- someone is watching Reese as he walks to
the windows of his new home and looks out. The shot cuts...

OVER BLACK: the BEEP of voicemail.

                       JESSICA (V.O.)
           Hi mom. Didn't want you to worry.
           Just down in Mexico with Cindy.
           Back tomorrow. Love you.

INT.   HOTEL ROOM, BAJA - DAY

A hand reaches over unmade sheets. Hangs up the phone.
This is JESSICA, 20s: beautiful, funny, alive.

                        VOICE (O.S.)
           Cindy?   I look like a Cindy?

Lying in bed, 10 years younger: Reese. Or whatever name he
was going by then. Shirtless, hungover, smitten.

                       JESSICA
           My mom's still upset over me calling
           things off with Peter. You know
           this. She really liked him.

                       'REESE'
           Everybody likes Pete. I'm beginning
           to think you got a bum deal, trading
           an officer for an enlisted man.

                       JESSICA
           I'm beginning to think that, too.
                                                                 22.

Jessica pulls him back onto the bed.    Playful.    They kiss.
She rolls over, relaxed, happy.

                      JESSICA (CONT'D)
          I wish this weekend could go on
          forever.

                      'REESE'
          It already has. It's Tuesday...

He climbs off the bed.    Begins pulling on his uniform pants.

                      JESSICA
          Which means you have to head back to
          base. And I won't see you again for
          two weeks. I hate it.

He looks at her in the mirror on the dresser.      Smiles.

                      'REESE'
          So tell me to stay. And I will.
          I'll quit.

                         JESSICA
          OK... Stay.

He holds her smile for a moment.   She shakes her head.

                      JESSICA (CONT'D)
          You would never do that.

                      'REESE'
          I already did.
              (off her look)
          They wanted to ship me out. Diego
          Garcia. Six months. So I said no.
          I said I've been seeing this girl.
          Didn't want to take the chance she
          wouldn't be here when I got back.

She's stunned. Speechless. She pulls him into a kiss.
Then pulls away, still not believing it.

                      JESSICA
          The army was your whole life.

                      'REESE'
          Truth is, they don't need us. I've
          trained my whole life for something
          that's never going to happen. Russia,
          China -- everyone's too busy getting
          rich to go to war. There aren't any
          bad guys left. I'm 28 years old and
          I'm already obsolete.

                       'REESE' (CONT'D)
           And I love it. Because it means I
           get to be with you.
               (beat)
           I get my discharge in a month. I'm
           going to buy a boat. You can be my
           first mate.

He pats her thigh, playful. She reels him in for a kiss.
He breaks off after a second, grabs the ice bucket.

INT.   MANAGER'S OFFICE, HOTEL, BAJA - DAY

Reese makes his way to the tiny lobby with his ice bucket.
The MANAGER is engrossed on a tiny TV in the back office,
anguished rapid-fire Spanish.

                       'REESE'
           Amigo -- some, uh, hielo? Ice?

The manager finally looks away from the TV. Turns to fill
Reese's bucket. Reese looks at the TV, which we can't see.

                       'REESE' (CONT'D)
           What is that? A movie?

                          MANAGER
           No.   Ahora.    Right now.   New York.

                       'REESE'
           Someone crashed a plane?

                       MANAGER
           Two... two planes.

Off Reese's face, watching the world change:

INT. BULLPEN, NINTH PRECINCT - DAY

Detective Carter is hunched over her desk, looking at Reese's
sketch and case file. Another HOMICIDE DETECTIVE walks up.

                       HOMICIDE DETECTIVE
           Any luck finding Paul Bunyan?

                       CARTER
           Turns out 'bearded loner' covers a
           surprisingly high percentage of the
           homeless population.

The detective walks off, laughing. Carter pulls out the
file on the murder in New Rochelle that was a match for
Reese's fingerprints. Looks at a photo of the victim, a
good-looking man in his 40s: PETER ARNDT. Picks up the phone.
                                                            24.

                         CARTER (CONT'D)
             Is this New Rochelle Police? I'm
             trying to reach Detective Nichols.
                 (beat)
             Can I leave a message? Tell him
             it's about the Arndt murder. I think
             I found the man he's looking for.
                 (beat)
             And then I lost him.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

Reese is seated in the back of the courtroom, reading through
Bray's email on his phone.

                         REESE (V.O.)
             Given Bray's conviction record, we've
             got hundreds of people we could be
             looking at. So I'm starting with
             the people she seems to be the most
             worried about. I cut the list to
             three.

INT. DERELICT LIBRARY - DAY -- INTERCUT

Finch watches as Reese walks him through the documents he's
put together.

                         REESE
             The first is Alonzo Pope, the drug
             dealer she's currently prosecuting.
             Pope is accused of murdering a group
             of drug dealers and their mob
             suppliers at a handoff. He took
             half a million dollars in cash and
             drugs and left five bodies.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY -- INTERCUT

Pope, the defendant, sits in the witness box as Bray asks
him questions. He looks bored.

                         POPE
             I was with a girl.   Don't remember
             her name.

                         REESE (V.O.)
             His gang might be targeting Bray for
             reprisal for prosecuting him.

Pope mugs.    His friends in the back of the courtroom LAUGH.

                         BRAY
             We have surveillance footage of your
             vehicle leaving the crime scene.
                                                           25.

                       POPE
              (shrugs)
          Someone stole it.

                      BRAY
          So, in short, someone took your car,
          then killed your friends and stole
          their money. And you're asking the
          jury to believe that it wasn't you?

                      POPE
          I wouldn't have done them like that.
          Wouldn't have left Terrence bleeding
          out, begging for his girl.

Something about his answer rankles Bray.   She recovers.

                      BRAY
          So you're telling us that you didn't
          do it because you would have been a
          more compassionate killer?

                       POPE
          No.   I would have had better aim.

Pope lowers his eyes.

                      REESE (V.O.)
          The second person I'm looking into
          is Miller, her co-counselor.

Bray walks back to the table where her co-counselor, Miller,
is waiting. She doesn't make eye contact with him.

INT. DERELICT LIBRARY - DAY

Finch looks surprised.

                       FINCH
          An ADA?   Why?

                      REESE
          They've been working together five
          years. Dated for a few months last
          year. I found a document that Bray
          had to submit to the county's HR
          department disclosing the
          relationship.

EXT. STREETS, LOWER MANHATTAN - DAY

Reese follows Bray and Miller as they walk back from the
courthouse to the D.A.'s offices. They're arguing.
                                                             26.

                       REESE (V.O.)
           She broke things off. Last month
           she filed a request to be partnered
           with a different ADA going forward.

                       FINCH (V.O.)
           I'm still not sure I understand.

                       REESE (V.O.)
           Forty percent of murders involve
           some kind of romantic relationship.

EXT.   BATTERY PARK CITY - DAY

Reese watches Miller eating lunch by himself, reading case
files.

                       REESE (V.O.)
           Miller's divorced. One kid. Sees
           him on alternating weekends. Upside-
           down on his mortgage on a condo in
           Queens. Credit card bills. Career
           trajectory stalled out. One of the
           support staff warned Bray that Miller
           had been asking questions about her,
           pulling copies of her old case files.

                       FINCH (V.O.)
           You said there was a third person
           you were looking into?

                       REESE (V.O.)
           Ex-convict named William Robinson.

INT.   FAST FOOD RESTAURANT, BROOKLYN - DAY

Reese stands in line. Reaches the CASHIER, 40s, weary-looking
under a paper hat. His name tag reads 'WILLIAM.'

                       REESE (V.O.)
           Bray and Miller prosecuted him three
           years back. Armed robbery. Robinson
           wrote them threatening letters from
           prison. He was released two months
           ago. Bray got an email from a friend
           on the parole board. She pulled
           Robinson's file.

INT.   LOBBY, TENEMENT - NIGHT

Reese scans the buzzer box.      Finds 'Robinson, W.   6D'
                                                             27.

INT.   CRAMPED APARTMENT, TENEMENT - NIGHT

The door opens, revealing the number 6D. And Reese with a
lock pick set. Reese looks over the meager space: one bed,
one chair, one book. He opens the cover: the Holy Bible.

A NOISE at the door -- a key turning in the deadbolt. Reese
looks around, annoyed. Steps behind the door. Robinson steps
inside, still wearing his fast food uniform. Reese steps
behind him, close.

                         REESE
               (low)
           Don't move.

Robinson freezes, arms raised, meek.

                       ROBINSON
           I don't have much, but you're welcome
           to take whatever you need. I've
           been where you've been.

Reese backs through the door.    Then he's gone.

EXT.   STREETS, BROOKLYN - NIGHT

Reese walks quickly through the crowds.     Dials Finch.

                        REESE
           I don't think Robinson is our man.
           He burned through a box of
           highlighters on his King James Bible.
           None of it Old Testament. Or
           Revelations.

                       FINCH (V.O.)
           Bray's on the move. She called the
           county lockup and arranged to see
           Pope. Alone.

Reese steps to the curb and hails a cab.

                         REESE
           I'm on it.

INT.   TAXI, LOWER MANHATTAN - NIGHT

Reese watches as Bray parks her car in front of the Manhattan
Detention Complex and walks inside.

INT.   INTERVIEW ROOM, MANHATTAN DETENTION COMPLEX - NIGHT

Bray waits in a meeting room.      Pope is walked in.
                                                          28.

                       POPE
           I spend the whole day answering your
           questions, lady.

                       BRAY
           You're going to answer a few more.

                       POPE
           Isn't my lawyer supposed to be here
           for this-

                       BRAY
           I can call him if you want. But the
           reason I'm here is that I don't think
           you murdered those people.

Pope looks at her, evaluating.

                       BRAY (CONT'D)
           You said today in court that Terrence
           was calling out for his girlfriend.
           But that wasn't in the transcripts
           of his 911 call. The officer wrote
           it down as garbled. And the killers
           had left by that point. Which means
           someone else was there, in the house
           when he made the call. Someone who
           told you what Terrence said.

                       POPE
           What do you care?

                       BRAY
           I do this job because I want to take
           dangerous people off the streets.
           If you didn't do it, that means the
           killers are still out there. If
           there's someone out there who can
           identify them, why haven't you told
           me about them?

Pope is silent.   Stonewalling her.    Why?

                       BRAY (CONT'D)
               (realizing)
           Are you protecting them?

EXT.   MANHATTAN DETENTION CENTER - NIGHT

In the parking lot, huddled behind a parked car. Reese.
Listening in, with Finch on the line. He remembers something.
                                                              29.

                      REESE
              (low)
          The brother. Pope's got a brother.
          It's in his case file.

INT. INTERVIEW ROOM, MANHATTAN DETENTION COMPLEX - NIGHT

She looks through the files. Stops on a page.     She's had
the same realization as Reese.

                      BRAY
          Was it Michael? Your younger brother?
          He was friends with Terrence. Was
          he there that night? Did he see the
          real killers? Can he ID them?

Pope's face softens for a moment. She's found his weak point.
Then it's gone, replaced with pure fear. His voice drops,
as if he's afraid they're being listened to.

                      POPE
          You should just leave this alone,
          lady. Just move on. You have no
          idea what you're getting involved
          in. Who these guys are.

                      BRAY
          So you know. You know who murdered
          your friends. Your brother saw them,
          and he told you. And you're going
          to let us put you away for life for
          what they did?

                       POPE
              (laughs)
          I've done some things... You lock
          me up, I figure I'll just make amends
          for the things you never caught me
          on. Because I'm bad, you see. But
          these men... these men are evil.
          They kill anyone they want. They
          take anything they want. And they
          are protected from on high. If I
          talk to you they'll kill me. And my
          brother. And the rest of my family.
              (beat)
          I can do the time. I can keep my
          mouth shut. You leave my brother
          out of this.

                      BRAY
          Is it the mob? Someone we haven't
          heard of? Another gang?
                                                           30.

                        POPE
               (laughs)
           Something like that.

Pope stands. Moves to the door to wait for the guards.
Bray pleads with him, keeping her voice low.

                       BRAY
           Listen to me. Whoever these men
           are, you can trust me. I can protect
           you. I can protect your brother,
           Michael. But you have to tell me
           what you know. You said they're
           protected... what do you mean?

Pope laughs.   Stands.    Bangs the door for the guards.

                       POPE
           Let it go, lady. You keep asking
           questions, they'll just kill you,
           too.

EXT.   MANHATTAN DETENTION CENTER - NIGHT

A CORRECTIONS OFFICER is walking closer, patrolling the
parking lot. Reese stands. Starts walking.

                       REESE
           Finch? You want to unburden yourself
           of some of that knowledge you're
           carrying around? I need to find
           Pope's brother. Fast.

                         END OF ACT ONE
                                                            31.

                         ACT TWO

EXT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY

We can see Bray as she paces back and forth in her office,
talking to someone on her land line. The audio is picked up
by her cell phone, which is on her desk. Her words are only
clear when she turns back from the window.

                       BRAY (V.O.)
           We need to find this boy, Michael
           Pope...
               (turns from window)
           ...No one can know until I'm sure...
           Miller is trying to find out...

EXT.   ROOFTOP, HIGH RISE - DAY

Reese watches through binoculars. He turns the gain up on
his cell phone, but he still can't hear the whole
conversation. He watches as Bray hangs up and grabs her
coat and bag. Talks to Finch on his phone.

                       REESE
           She's trying to track down Pope's
           brother, Michael. He's the one who
           knows who really killed those drug
           dealers. Problem is, if the real
           killers are still out there, they
           may be watching Bray. Finding that
           kid may be the last thing she does.
           We have to find the kid first. And
           figure out who the killers are before
           she can.

                       FINCH (V.O.)
           I could only find a handful of leads
           on the brother. Child protective
           services had a last know address.
           And he had pages on a handful of
           social networking sites. I'm looking
           for addresses for his friends.

REESE'S P.O.V. Bray turns at a KNOCK on her office door.
Miller steps in.

                       MILLER (V.O.)
           You went to see Pope last night?

                       BRAY (V.O.)
           I wanted to give him one more chance
           to turn in his accomplices. Cut a
           deal.
                                                             32.

                       MILLER (V.O.)
           He give you anything?

                        BRAY (V.O.)
           Nothing.   As usual. I'm late.

She ushers him out of her office.   Pulls the door closed.
Heads for the elevators.

BACK TO SCENE

                       REESE
           She's stonewalling Miller about Pope's
           brother. She doesn't trust him.
           Maybe she thinks he's involved?

Reese begins to set down the binoculars.    Begins to pull on
his coat. Stops.

                       REESE (CONT'D)
           Wait a second...

REESE'S P.O.V. Miller waits a beat, then slips into Bray's
office. He pulls up her browser history, then pulls up a
picture of Michael Pope from the child protective services
intranet. Prints it.

                       REESE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Turns out there's a good reason she
           doesn't trust Miller.

Reese drops the binoculars.   Heads for the door.

                       FINCH (V.O.)
           What do you think it means?

                       REESE
           It means we better find this kid
           quickly.

EXT.   LOW-RISE APARTMENT, LOWER BRONX - DAY

A WOMAN, 40s, leaves her door on the chain, eyes Bray up and
down.

                       BRAY
           I'm looking for Michael Pope?

                       WOMAN
           Doesn't live here anymore.

The woman SLAMS the door.
                                                             33.

EXT.   CORNER, LOWER BRONX - DAY

A group of low-level DRUG DEALERS are operating off of the
stoop of a boarded up building. A LOOKOUT on the corner
WHISTLES as Reese walks up. Reese smiles at the main DEALER,
then climbs up the stoop and sits down next to him. The
dealer mutes his bluetooth headset. Looks at Reese,
unimpressed.

                       DEALER
           You want something?

                       REESE
           Just taking a break. Looking for a
           friend of yours named Michael Pope.
           You know where I can find him?

                       DEALER
           You a cop or just crazy?     Keep moving.

A prospective CUSTOMER drives up.     Reese smiles down at him.

                       REESE
           How you doing?

The customer pulls away, tires SQUEALING.

                       DEALER
           Listen, this here is a recession. I
           have five employees to pay. You
           don't want to interfere with the
           economic recovery. And I don't want
           to shoot you.

Reese raises his hands.   No trouble.    He walks off.

                       FINCH (V.O.)
           Did you get it?

Reese checks his phone.   He's cloned the dealer's cell phone.

                       REESE
           I got it. Kid's smart. Nothing
           stored in the phone's memory. Police
           could use it to prove criminal
           conspiracy. Keeps the phone numbers
           memorized. Wait. Here we go.

He reads the screen. He's watching the dealer type out a
text, real time: 'Po-9 looking for you. Watch out.' After
a moment a response pops up: 'Thanks.'

Reese taps out his own text, spoofing the dealer's number.
'Checking your house, next. You home?' After a moment the
response comes back. 'Nope. Killmer.'
                                                             34.

EXT.   KILLMER PARK, LOWER BRONX - DAY

Reese scans the park. He spots a group of three TEENAGERS
sitting on a park bench. One of them is MICHAEL POPE, 16,
backpack and a Jets hat.  He spots Reese a mile away.

                        REESE
           Michael?   I just want to talk-

And the kid is running.   Fast.   Reese follows.

EXT.   STREETS, LOWER BRONX - DAY

Michael keeps moving, ducking between parked cars. The
entrance to the subway is right ahead. Suddenly Reese pops
out in front of him, grabs his arm.

                        REESE
           Slow up.   I got a message from your
           brother.

                       MICHAEL
           You don't know my brother.

                       REESE
           Not exactly. But I know what you
           saw. And I'm not the only one looking
           for you. You need my help.

                       MICHAEL
           Your help? You've got to be kidding
           me. Let go.

Up ahead, a group of CONSTRUCTION WORKERS taking a lunch
break. The kid spots them. Yells.

                       MICHAEL (CONT'D)
           HELP. Help me. This guy tried to
           get me into a cab with him. Said he
           wanted to take pictures of me.

The construction workers set down their lunches and begin
walking towards them. Reese raises a hand -- he's not
touching the kid. As he does he takes out his cell phone,
slips it into the outer pocket of Michael's backpack.

Michael darts down into the subway, leaving Reese to deal
with the construction workers.

INT. DERELICT LIBRARY - DAY

Reese walks in to find Finch staring at a map of the city.
                                                           35.

                       FINCH
           I can't get a GPS fix on the phone
           you slipped into Michael's backpack.
           He must still be on the subway.

                       REESE
           He'll have to come up for air sooner
           or later. When he does I'll pick
           him up.

Reese is pulling open drawers, looking through cabinets.

                       FINCH
           Something you need?

                       REESE
           If Pope is right these men his brother
           can ID are very very bad guys. I'm
           going to need more than a cell phone
           going up against them.

                       FINCH
           About that -- I don't like firearms
           very much.

                       REESE
           Neither do I. My philosophy is, if
           someone has to have them, I'd rather
           it was me.

                       FINCH
               (resigned)
           We can get you whatever you need.

                       REESE
           No. We wouldn't want them being
           traced back to you. Besides, I've
           got a line on some. Lightly used.
           Steep discount.
               (heads for the door)
           Call me when that kid turns up.

EXT.   SUBURBS, NEW ROCHELLE - DAY

Detective Carter pulls a flier from the For Sale sign planted
in the front yard of a large house in a subdivision. SUPER
TITLE: WESTCHESTER COUNTY. An unmarked cruiser pulls up,
and DETECTIVE NICHOLS, 40s, climbs out.

                       NICHOLS
           Detective Carter?

INT.   EMPTY HOUSE, NEW ROCHELLE - DAY

Carter follows Nichols through the house.
                                                             36.

                       CARTER
           This is where they found the body?

                       NICHOLS
           No. Fight started in here. Assailant
           was waiting for him. Even poured
           himself a drink. Peter Arndt --
           that's the victim -- comes home.
           Neighbor saw him pull in, didn't
           hear the noise until a few minutes
           later. Musta been a hell of a fight.
           Arndt was a big boy. Six-five. 250
           pounds. Ex-Army officer.

Carter looks at her file. Peter Arndt smiles back at her
from a corporate prospectus.

                       NICHOLS (CONT'D)
           You were telling me on the phone
           that you have this guy?

                        CARTER
           Had him.   Arndt lived here alone?

                       NICHOLS
           The wife died in the fall. Car
           accident. EMTs didn't find them for
           hours. Husband survived. Just to
           die like this.
               (beat)
           Listen, Detective, I know you run
           into all sorts down in the city.
           But if the guy you're looking for
           can do this to an Army Ranger, well-
           I would let your service weapon ask
           most of the questions.

Carter looks at the picture of Peter Arndt.

EXT.   BODEGA, QUEENS - DAY

A familiar Range Rover pulls up, HEAVIES climb out. Last
one out, looking chagrined, hand still bandaged, is Anton.

INT.   BODEGA - DAY

The heavies walk through the store and disappear into the...

INT.   STOCKROOM, BODEGA - DAY

Cases of soda, cartons of chips, and guns. Lots and lots of
guns, laid out on the floor. Heavy ordinance. AR-15s,
handguns, body armor. Even a 40mm grenade launcher. A
heavyset TURK presides over them like a greengrocer. Anton
pesters his FATHER, 50s, as they look over the merchandise.
                                                              37.

                      ANTON'S FATHER
          How much for the AR-15s?

                      TURK
          Four thousand apiece. It's a
          recession. City's getting dangerous.

                      REESE (O.S.)
          You guys seen the men's room?

Everyone turns.   Reese is standing in the doorway.   He smiles.

                      REESE (CONT'D)
          Hey, Anton -- good to see you again.

                      ANTON'S FATHER
          You know this guy?

Anton shakes his head. Reese looks at the weapons on the
floor. WHISTLES, impressed.

                      REESE
          That's some pretty serious equipment.
          Have you guys taken a safety course?

A series of CLICKS as four weapons are pointed at him. Reese
turns to one of the men, who's holding his gun sideways.

                      REESE (CONT'D)
          Take you -- you're holding the thing
          sideways. Can't aim it, for one.
          And two, it'll eject a shell casing
          right into your face.

The man with the sideways gun walks closer. Reese moves
fast, grabs the man's gun arm and forces it up. The gun
FIRES, and the red hot shell casing ejects into the guy's
face with a sizzle.

                       REESE (CONT'D)
          Then you might have an accidental
          discharge...

Reese aims the man's arm, FIRING a round into the knees of
each of the remaining men. When the dust clears, everyone
but Anton is lying on the ground, clutching a wounded body
part. Reese steps over them. Unfolds a duffel on the floor
and begins to load weapons into it.

                      REESE (CONT'D)
          I'm going to hold onto these while
          you guys get some practice.

Reese zips up the duffel.   Smiles at Anton on his way out.

INT.   TERMINAL, O'HARE AIRPORT - DAY -- FLASHBACK

Surveillance footage of the endless commuters filing through
O'Hare. A WOMAN in the crowd stops. She's seen someone.

INT.   BAR, O'HARE AIRPORT - DAY -- FLASHBACK

The woman is Jessica, the same woman Reese was with in Mexico.
She moves into the bar, looking like she has seen a ghost.

                        JESSICA
           John?

The man she's talking to doesn't look up, as if he doesn't
answer to that name anymore. Finally, as she sets her hands
on his table, he looks up. It's Reese. He looks around.
No one has heard her use his name. He offers her a chair.

                       JESSICA (CONT'D)
           I didn't know you were back from...
           over there.

                        REESE
           I'm not.   Just... passing through.

He looks away, as if he can't bring himself to look at her.

                       JESSICA
           Where's your uniform?

                       REESE
           I... got a new job.

                       JESSICA
           One of those jobs you don't talk
           about.
               (smiles, knowingly)
           You said you were going to quit.
           Took a little longer than you said.

Reese opens his mouth to say something.   Something real.
Then he changes his mind.

                       REESE
           You got engaged?

She holds out a hand with a big ugly diamond on it.

                       JESSICA
           Peter left the army for a corporate
           job. Just like you said he would.

                       REESE
           Peter's a good man.
                                                              39.

A moment passes between them.    The airport PA ANNOUNCES her
flight. She stands to leave.

                      JESSICA
          Is there a number I can reach you
          on? We moved back east and I... I
          get a little homesick.

Reese looks at her for a beat.   Writes down a phone number.

                      REESE
          It's voicemail. I check the messages
          every couple weeks.

She looks at the paper. Then back at him, summoning the
nerve to tell him what she really wants him to know.

                      JESSICA
          I waited for you.

                      REESE
          I didn't ask you to.

                      JESSICA
          No you didn't. You just left.
          Because you knew Peter would take
          care of me. Because you thought
          you'd get killed over there and it
          would hurt me.

He doesn't say anything.    She laughs, her mood darkening.

                      JESSICA (CONT'D)
          How noble of you. What a sacrifice.
          Don't fool yourself. You know what
          the truth is? You were scared. You
          didn't want to have to worry about
          me. It was easier for you to be
          alone.

He looks away for a beat.   She's right.

                      REESE
          That's one of the things you learn
          over there. In the end, we're all
          alone. No one cares. No one's
          keeping score. No one's coming to
          save you...

                      JESSICA
          You don't believe that. Not really.
          You want to be brave? Take a risk.
              (beat)
          Tell me to leave Peter.

                      JESSICA (CONT'D)
          Tell me to wait for you. Say the
          words right now and I'll do it.

She looks at him, catching his eye, challenging. He is
silent. Staring at her. Torn apart. She steps back.

                       JESSICA (CONT'D)
          But that would take some real courage.
          Wouldn't it?

She takes another step backwards, waiting for him to say
something. Then she turns and disappears into the crowd.

For a moment he's completely alone. Finally, long after
she's gone, he speaks, his voice breaking.

                         REESE
              (low)
          Wait for me.    Please.

INT. CAB, MIDTOWN - NIGHT

Reese watches the city lights pass him in a blur. His bag
of guns is on the seat next to him. His phone RINGS. He
finally answers.

                      REESE
          Did you find the kid?

                      FINCH (V.O.)
          Not yet. But it's Bray. I lost her
          signal. I think the battery on her
          phone may have died. She was near
          her apartment when I lost her.

Reese, pissed, thinking fast.

                      REESE
          Pull up her email. Recent credit
          card bills. We're looking for charges
          in her neighborhood. Bars,
          restaurants. Start with anything
          that comes up more than once.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Reese scans the tables at the restaurant.   People eating,
happy, oblivious. Reese is tense.

                      REESE
          Give me the next one.
                                                            41.

INT.   BAR, MIDTOWN - NIGHT

Reese steps inside. The bar is filled with the usual
collection of yuppies, drunks, and college kids. No Bray.
He moves over to the bar. The BARTENDER walks up.

                       REESE
           Club soda. I'm looking for someone.
           Brunette, about five nine...

                       BARTENDER
           Looks like you found her.

Reese turns just as Bray walks up from the restrooms at the
back of the bar and sits down at a half-finished whisky and
water. She notices Reese staring at her. Smiles.

Reese nods. Begins to walk away right as the bartender sets
a club soda down in front of him. It would be more suspicious
to leave, so he sits. Bray opens her briefcase and pulls
out a case file. Begins going through a trial transcript.
Jots a note. Her pen is out of ink. She looks at Reese.

                       BRAY
           Excuse me -- do you have a pen?

                       REESE
               (hands her pen)
           Looks like you like your job.

She looks at him, evaluating.

                       BRAY
           Most guys tell me I work too much.

                       REESE
           Most guys don't like their jobs.
           Feel threatened by a woman who does.

                       BRAY
           How about you?

                       REESE
           Just started a new one. Haven't
           decided if I like it, yet.

Reese's phone vibrates. He checks the screen. A text from
Finch reads: 'Leave. Now.' Reese stands to leave.

                       REESE (CONT'D)
           Speaking of which.

                       BRAY
           Don't forget your bag.
                                                                42.

Reese looks back at the gym bag tucked under the bar.      Grabs
it. Smiles at Bray and heads for the door.

EXT. BAR, MIDTOWN - NIGHT

Reese steps outside.     Hails a cab.   Puts his earpiece in.

                       REESE
           You found the kid?

                      FINCH (V.O.)
           Yes. But I think someone else found
           him first. Listen-

Reese's earpiece fills with the noise from the open mic on
the cell phone he planted on the kid earlier.

INT.   SUV - NIGHT

Michael and his backpack are crushed on the floor of the
backseat. An ARMED MAN, 30s, full sleeve tattoos, holds a
gun on the kid while his PARTNER drives uptown fast.

                       TATTOOED GUNMAN
           You were going to tell them all about
           us, weren't you, Mikey?

                          MICHAEL
           Kiss my ass.

INT.   CAB - NIGHT -- INTERCUT

Reese checks his phone. Listens in on the open mic on his
phone in Michael's backpack.

                       TATTOOED GUNMAN (O.S.)
           We're taking him back uptown. We'll
           put a couple in the back of his head.
           Make it look like a gang thing.

Finch's voice cuts in.

                       FINCH (O.S.)
           Are you listening to this?     You need
           to do something.

                          REESE
           I'm on it.

Reese unzips the gym bag.     Starts discretely checking over
his weapons.
                                                               43.

EXT.   96TH AND AMSTERDAM - NIGHT

The cab pulls up. Reese calmly pays and climbs out.    Checks
Michael's position on his cell phone.

Reese jogs the remaining block towards the park. Pulls a
ski mask out of the bag. Slips it over his head. Then he
shoulders the 40mm grenade launcher. Strides into the middle
of the intersection at Central Park West.

INT. SUV - NIGHT

The driver sees Reese standing in the intersection, aiming
the grenade launcher at them.

                          DRIVER
           What the...

EXT. 96TH AND CENTRAL PARK WEST - NIGHT

Reese fires. The    tear gas grenade ARCS gracefully towards
the speeding car,   then SMASHES into its windshield and
EXPLODES, filling   the car with tear gas. The SUV veers up
onto the sidewalk   and SLAMS into a light pole.

Doors open and the gunman climbs out, coughing, blinded by
tear gas. Reese SHOOTS the driver in the knee. Grabs the
tattooed man by his throat and KNOCKS him cold against the
car door. Grabs the kid.

Reese reaches down and grabs the wallet from the tattooed
gunman. Pulls the kid into the park.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

Reese pulls off his ski mask as they make their way further
into the park. Hands Michael a water bottle.

                       REESE
           Use this to wash out your eyes.

                       MICHAEL
           You're crazy. They're just going to
           kill you, too, now. Do you know who
           those guys are?

Reese pulls out the tattooed man's wallet to check the ID.

                          REESE
           I do now.     They're cops.

The wallet holds a big gold badge: NYPD.

                         END OF ACT TWO

                        ACT THREE

EXT. 42ND PRECINCT POLICE STATION, BRONX - DAY

The tattooed cop, wrist bandaged, pissed off, walks out of
the station with two other COPS.

Watching them, from across the street, in a coffee shop:
Reese. He snaps a series of pictures as the cops climb into
an unmarked car and pull away.

EXT.   SIDE STREET, BRONX - DAY

Reese watches from a taxi as the unmarked car pulls   to a
halt. After a moment an overweight man climbs down    the stoop
and leans into the window. Reese recognizes him as    Detective
Fusco -- the homicide detective who arrested Pope.    Reese
snaps another picture.

INT. DERELICT LIBRARY - DAY

Reese, agitated, is staring at a complete set of pictures of
the tattooed cop, Fusco, and the others. He checks his watch,
agitated. Tries to call Finch. No answer.

He walks to the bulletin board with the list. Looks at the
chaos of intersecting newspaper clippings and notes. He
notices something -- two of the notes are jotted on napkins.
Both napkins have the name of the same restaurant.

EXT.   STREETS, MIDTOWN - DAY

Finch walks out of a restaurant, alone. His security team
waits by the car. One of them sports a band-aid on his nose
from his earlier encounter with Reese.

                       REESE (O.S.)
           I don't know where you work. Or
           where you live. I'm not sure I know
           your real name. But I know where
           you eat lunch.

Finch turns. Reese is walking up the sidewalk. Tosses him
a balled up napkin with the same logo as the restaurant Finch
just walked out of. One of Finch's security guys steps
forward. Reese looks at him, menacing.

                       REESE (CONT'D)
           You want one to match your friend?

He points to the other security guy and his band-aid.   The
security man backs off. Reese turns to Finch.

                       REESE (CONT'D)
           We need to talk. Now.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

Finch and Reese walk through the park.

                      REESE
          What exactly have you gotten me into?

                      FINCH
          I don't know. That's the whole point.

Reese hands Finch a file folder with some pictures: Stills,
the tattooed narcotics cop; and Fusco.

                      REESE
          The real killers are a group of
          corrupt cops led by this man: Stills.
          He used to be partners with Fusco,
          the homicide detective who collared
          Pope. Which explains how they were
          able to plant that much evidence on
          him. Stills has four men working in
          his unit. They've already murdered
          six people.

                      FINCH
          Six?

                      REESE
          Bray got a phone call this morning --
          Alonzo Pope was stabbed to death in
          his cell last night. I don't think
          they could get away with this without
          some help inside the DA's office.
          Which might explain why Bray became
          so suspicious of Miller.

Finch looks away, troubled.

                      REESE (CONT'D)
          These guys are cold blooded killers
          and they're closing up shop. I'm
          guessing they'll think it's better
          to take out Bray than to risk her
          catching on. But I don't know...
              (anger rising)
          I don't know anything. Because you
          won't tell me where you're getting
          this information...

Finch turns to look back at the city.    He looks at Reese.
Can he trust him?

                      FINCH
          When those towers came down, you

                      FINCH (CONT'D)
              (off his look)
          I was here. In New York. I was
          working. And I had said I didn't
          want to be disturbed. And I wasn't.
          I didn't know what had happened until
          I came out that evening. And everyone
          was gone. You see, Mr. Reese, that
          day didn't just change your life.
          It changed mine, as well. I had
          spent most of my life up to that
          moment making myself very very rich.
          But that didn't seem to amount to
          very much. So I decided to do
          something about it. I decided to
          build something.

                      REESE
          What kind of something?

                      FINCH
          After the attacks the information
          flowing into the intelligence
          communities was like a fire hose.
          Human analysts weren't capable of
          sorting through it all. So I built
          something that could do it for them.
          A machine that would listen to every
          phone call. Read every email. Watch
          through every camera. And pick the
          terrorists out of the general
          population before they can act.

                      REESE
          I worked for the government. They
          don't have anything like this.

                      FINCH
          If anyone ever found out they did,
          the program would be shut down
          immediately. That's the devil's
          bargain: the public wanted to be
          protected. No one wanted anything
          like that to happen again. They just
          didn't want to know how they were
          protected.

Finch turns back from the city.   Watches kids playing in the
park, carefree.

                      FINCH (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          But there was a problem with the
          machine. I built it to stop terrorist

          Civilization-shattering events. But
          it saw all sorts of crimes in the
          planning stages: Murders.
          Kidnappings.

          I had built the machine to stop the
          next 9/11. Not the next mob hit.
          Not the next jealous husband. And
          so I altered the software. I taught
          the machine to divide the things it
          saw into two categories: relevant,
          and irrelevant. Events that would
          cause massive loss of life or threaten
          national security were relevant.
          They were passed along at the highest
          channels to the NSA or the FBI.

Reese smiles, sardonic, beginning to understand.

                       REESE (V.O.)
          And what happens to the 'irrelevant'
          information?

                      FINCH (V.O.)
          Every night, at midnight, the machine
          collates the irrelevant information --
          the gangland bosses and the serial
          killers and the jilted lovers and
          all of their awful plans -- and it
          erases it. Throws it all away.

Finch lowers his voice.    This is a secret he's carried for a
long, long time.

                      FINCH (CONT'D)
          I didn't want to play God. I just
          never wanted to see anything like
          what happened that day happen again.
              (beat)
          It was only later that I realized
          my... mistake. That the knowledge
          that that list was out there would
          eat away at me. All of those people
          who had no idea what was coming for
          them.

Reese takes it all in.    The scale of it.

                      REESE
          So where is this machine now?

P.O.V. TRAFFIC CAMERA - CONTINUOUS

A distant camera picks out Finch and Reese through the trees.
The audio is pieced together, a Doppler stream from passing
cell phones. God peering through a million keyholes.

          It had to be the smallest piece of

          Nine digits. That's all we get.

          him in touch with Bray and he
          testifies, someone will kill him
          sooner or later. Like they killed
          his brother. And I don't know if I
          can protect Bray.

Finch turns to walk back to his car.

          I never said the job would be easy,

EXT. PARKING LOT, QUEENS - DAY

Reese watches from the shadows as Stills and his men shake
down a group of drug dealers on the corner. They look pissed --
they're looking for Michael and the man who took him. Stills
is a sadist -- he enjoys this.

EXT. VACANT OFFICE, HIGH RISE - NIGHT

Reese scans the DA's building opposite with his binoculars.

REESE'S P.O.V -- Miller is burning the midnight oil, digging
through boxes of old case files, looking for something.

EXT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Reese watches from a street corner as Fusco stakes out the
restaurant in his unmarked car.

After a moment, the lights in the restaurant flicker off.
William Robinson, the born-again ex-con, walks out with the
NIGHT MANAGER. Begins walking home. Fusco follows him.

INT. DERELICT LIBRARY - NIGHT

Reese mixes pieces from the assault rifles he stole from the
mob. He zeroes the sites. Finch is looking at the
information Reese has pulled together. Pictures of Stills,
Fusco, Bray, Miller, Robinson. Reese looks up.

                      REESE
          I think I'm starting to see what
          your machine is seeing. Stills,
          Fusco and their men get word of bigger
          deals. They frame up a suspect,
          then steal the drugs, the money, and
          kill all the witnesses.

           I've gone through the records. At
           least four cases that fit the profile
           over the last three years. But they
           couldn't do it alone. They needed
           someone inside the D.A.'s office.

                        FINCH
           Miller?

                       REESE
           Each of the four cases were prosecuted
           by him and Bray. Miller's got a new
           project, one he's been working on in
           secret. He's been going through all
           of the cases he worked with Bray.
               (points to a picture)
           All of a sudden Fusco is following
           William Robinson home. The same
           Robinson who wrote Bray and Miller
           death threats from prison.

                       FINCH
           You think they're looking for someone
           they can frame Bray's murder on?

           No.   I think they've found him.

Reese shoulders the rifle. It fits neatly under his coat.
He stuffs the pockets with flashbang grenades.

PER-LAP SOUND: the BEEP of voicemail.

The room is hot, breeze cutting through curtains. Weapons

Her voice cuts out. Reese looks at the phone, disturbed.
There's a KNOCK on the door, followed by rapid-fire URDU.
Reese looks at the phone again, then hangs up.

EXT.   PORT AUTHORITY BUS TERMINAL - DAY

Reese waits to put Michael Pope onto a bus for Baltimore.
Puts some cash in his pocket.

Reluctantly, the kid climbs onto the bus.

EXT. PORT AUTHORITY BUS TERMINAL - DAY

As Reese walks out, his phone rings.

                       FINCH (V.O.)
           Bray's leaving her office. She got
           a call from someone claiming to have
           information on the shooters. They
           wanted her to meet at Remsen and
           Avenue D in Canarsie. 20 minutes.

Reese tries to hail a cab. Suddenly, the cabs have run dry.
Typical New York. Reese heads down a side street. Finds a
parked car. Waits for a quiet moment, then smashes the window
with the butt of his rifle. Climbs inside and hotwires the
car.

EXT.   STREETS, QUEENS - DAY

Reese carves through traffic, trying to catch up.

INT.   HOMICIDE, NINTH PRECINCT - DAY

Carter walks up to her desk.   One of the other detectives
looks up from his phone.

                       HOMICIDE DETECTIVE
           Some cop from the sticks for you.

Carter answers the phone. Nichols, the homicide detective
in New Rochelle, is on the other end.

                       NICHOLS (V.O.)
           Carter? You wanted me to go through
           Arndt's file again. We had nothing
           on them. But I checked with the
           private security firm that covers
           that neighborhood. They had a couple
           calls over the years. Neighbors
           complaining about noise. One night
           they found the wife with a cut on
           her forehead. I talked to the guard
           who responded to the call. Said the
           wife was laughing about it by the
           time they got there, said she'd
           tripped on one of the kid's toys and
           fallen down the stairs.

The last word catches Carter short. She pulls open the file
on Arndt. Flips through the pictures looking for the wife.

                       CARTER
           That car accident. Did the coroner
           perform a full autopsy on the wife?

                       NICHOLS (V.O.)
           Cause of death was straightforward
           enough. Massive blunt trauma to the
           head. Car was a mangled wreck.

Carter hangs up. Pulls the 8x10 of the wife out and pins it
to her cube: it's Jessica. The girl from Reese's past.

EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY -- SURVEILLANCE

We're looking at Carter from a laptop camera in a business
across the street. She's framed by the window.

                       CARTER (V.O.)
           He knew you, didn't he? But he
           couldn't save you.

The shot cuts to static. Suddenly we're firing through
hundreds of shots. We settle on a traffic camera feed:

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

A station wagon pulls to the side of a deserted stretch of
highway. A MAN climbs out, pulls open the trunk, and pulls
out a WOMAN'S BODY. He drags the body to the passenger seat.
Props her inside. Closes the door. Stabs the passenger
side tire sidewall with a screwdriver. Throws the screwdriver
into the bushes. Gets back in the car. Pulls away.

EXT.   INDUSTRIAL AREA, CANARSIE - DAY

Reese pulls to a halt on Avenue D. Checks his cell phone --
Bray is a few blocks ahead. He ditches the car and walks
along the sidewalk. The neighborhood is deserted.

Ahead, he sees an unmarked police cruiser pull to the curb a
block up. Stills climbs out, followed by three of his men.
Reese ducks out of sight. Stills looks up and down the
street, then directs his men to circle around the building,
trapping Bray.

EXT.   ALLEYWAY, CANARSIE - DAY

Reese moves quickly down the alleyway, diagonally towards
Bray's location. He calls Finch.

                       REESE
           They're coming for Bray now. I'm
           too late. Call her. Make something
           up. Get her out of here.

Reese glides silently down the alleyway, weapon drawn. Ahead,
he can see a small opening -- a loading dock behind an
abandoned warehouse. Bray is waiting there, alone. As Reese
watches, she checks the caller ID on her phone, then ignores
the call.

Reese moves forward, sticking to the shadows, weapon raised.
He can see Stills' men drawing closer on all sides.

                       BRAY
           Are you here?

REESE'S P.O.V -- Reese positions Stills' head in the
crosshairs. Exhales, ready for the shot.

                       BRAY (CONT'D)
           You're going to keep me waiting,
           Stills? We don't have time for this.

Stills steps out of the shadows. Bray turns to him.    Reese
takes his finger off the trigger, confused.
                                                               54.

                       STILLS
           What's the problem? Pope is dead.
           His brother hasn't turned up. Might
           be dead himself.

                       BRAY
           Miller. Miller's the problem, you
           idiot. He knows. About Pope. Maybe
           some of the others. He's got a file
           on you and your men, Stills. He's
           been working it up after hours. I
           told you we needed to take care of
           him weeks ago. I even picked out
           the shooter for you. No more dragging
           your feet.

                       STILLS
           How long have we got?

                       BRAY
           24 - 48 hours until he talks to the
           DA. Tops. I can take care of the
           files in his office. But that means
           you need to take care of Miller.
           Tonight.

Reese reacts. He was right about everything except the most
important element: Bray isn't the victim -- she's the
ringleader. He begins backing up the alleyway. He has to
tell Finch... and warn Miller.

Suddenly, a gun is pressed to his head.     Behind him: Fusco.

INT.   LOADING DOCK, CANARSIE - DAY

Fusco pushes Reese into the opening.   Bray, Stills, and the
others look up.

                       FUSCO
           We've got ourselves a groupie.
           Heavily armed, too.

He tosses Stills Reese's assault rifle.     Stills gives the
rifle the once over. Then Reese.

                       STILLS
           Lemme guess. You're the guy we ran
           into a couple nights ago.
               (to Bray)
           You know this guy?

                       BRAY
           No.
               (recognizing Reese)
           Wait. Yes. He's been following me.
                                                             55.

Stills PUNCHES Reese in the stomach. Reese doubles over in
pain. Stills pulls his wallet. Looks through the ID.

                       STILLS
           He's not law enforcement. The cartel
           finally grow some stones, send someone
           to take care of us?
               (leans closer)
           Who the hell are you?

He punches Reese again.     Reese laughs through the pain.

                          REESE
           Concerned...     Concerned third party.

Stills looks at Reese for a second, then SMASHES him in the
stomach with his rifle. Reese collapses with a grunt.

                       BRAY
           He's alone. That's what he is. So
           he doesn't matter. You take care of
           him. Then you take care of Miller.
           Tonight. Make it look clean.

Stills nods, obedient.

                       BRAY (CONT'D)
           And Stills? You screw this up, I
           won't let it get to me. I'll take
           care of you same as I took care of
           Pope. I can look out for myself.
           You know that.

With a final look at Reese, she turns and disappears. Stills
takes Reese's phone out of his pocket and SMASHES it on the
ground. Then he aims the butt of the rifle at Reese's head.
SMASHES it down. Reese collapses, losing consciousness.

OVER BLACK:

                        KID (V.O.)
           Mister?   You OK?

INT.   BUS, WESTCHESTER COUNTY - DAY

Reese, sporting three of four day's worth of beard, is sitting
on a bus. A group of KIDS are staring, wide-eyed, at a blood
stain spreading across Reese's shirt. Reese pulls his jacket
closed. It's still sprinkled with sand from a desert
somewhere.

                       KID
           What happened?
                                                             56.

                       REESE
           I... I quit my job.     Is this New
           Rochelle, yet?

The kids nod as the bus pulls to a halt.     Reese climbs off.

EXT.   STREETS, NEW ROCHELLE - DAY

Reese walks stiffly along the sidewalk -- he's clearly in
bad shape. He looks up and down the main street of the small
downtown area, as if expecting to see someone following him.

INT.   RECEPTION, HOSPITAL - DAY

Reese walks up to the TRIAGE NURSE.

                       TRIAGE NURSE
           Can I help you?

                       REESE
           No, I'm fine -- I'm actually looking
           for someone. A doctor. Jessica
           Arndt. I'm an old friend.

The nurse gives him a funny look.

                       REESE (CONT'D)
           She might not work here anymore.
           She was talking about... moving away.

The nurse is silent long enough that the sickening realization
of what she's going to say hits Reese before she can say it.

                       TRIAGE NURSE
           I'm sorry to have to tell you this.
           Dr. Arndt died in a car accident a
           few months ago...

It's as if Reese is drowning in her words. He leans forwards,
using a hand to steady himself, and we watch the last of
something vital dying in his eyes. The nurse is still
talking. He turns himself around, begins limping outside.

EXT. SUBURBS, NEW ROCHELLE - NIGHT

Reese sits, hunched in a stolen car, eyes blazing with pure
hate as he watches Peter Arndt climb into his car, heading
out to the gym. He waits a few seconds, then climbs out.

INT. FOYER, ARNDT HOUSE - NIGHT

With a POP, the lock gives way and Reese lets himself in.
This is the same house we've seen earlier, but filled with
Arndt's possessions.
                                                            57.

Reese looks around. Picks up a picture of Jessica. Stares
at it, overcome with anger and loss. Picks a bottle of
overpriced scotch from Arndt's bar. Pours himself a glass.
Then sits down in a comfortable chair to wait.

EXT. LOADING DOCK, CANARSIE - DAY

Finch's town car pulls up. Finch climbs out. Finds the
remains of Reese's cell phone. For the first time, we see
Finch's poker face crack: he looks worried.

INT.   UNMARKED CRUISER - DAY

The steady PERCUSSION of the car riding over frost heaves.
Reese comes to. Fusco is driving. They're in coastal Long
Island. Empty beach houses waiting for the weekend rush.

                        REESE
           Nice spot.

                       FUSCO
           Glad you like it. You're going to
           be here for a long, long time.

                       REESE
           I'm curious. Was there a point where
           you knew you'd become the bad guy?

                       FUSCO
           I got a mortgage to pay, same as
           everybody else. I woke up one
           morning. Realized the joke was on
           me. I was guarding a bunch of
           assholes on Wall Street who were
           stealing everyone blind. Earning my
           annual salary in an afternoon. So I
           figured 'what the hell'?

                       REESE
           I don't believe you. See I've been
           watching you, and I think there's a
           difference between you and your
           friends. Your heart's not really in
           it. Stills does it for money. I
           think you do it because you're loyal
           to Stills.

                       FUSCO
           What difference does it make?

                       REESE
           It's why I'm going to let you live.

Fusco LAUGHS. Then catches sight of Reese in the mirror.
Reese is relaxed. Unafraid. He continues.
                                                          58.

                       REESE (CONT'D)
           I'm considering sticking around New
           York for a while. And if I do, I'm
           going to need someone on the inside.
           You might come in handy.

                       FUSCO
               (playing along)
           So I'm going to work for you, now?

                       REESE
           That's right. But I've got two rules.
           One: you become an upstanding citizen.
           You hurt anybody, I'll kill you.
               (beat)
           And two: you have to be more careful.
           For instance, if you're going to put
           someone in the back of your car, you
           have to search them properly.

Fusco looks in the rear view mirror. Reese holds something
up with his bound hands: It's a flashbang grenade. He
smiles, pulls the pin. Drops the grenade and kicks it
forward, under the divider and into the driver's footwell.
Fusco panics, wrenching at the wheel. BANG.

EXT.   OCEAN PARKWAY, LONG ISLAND - DAY

The car swerves, drops one set of tires off the asphalt,
then swerves back and FLIPS, soaring into the air. The
cruiser SLIDES a hundred yards, coming to rest on its roof.

For a second it's still. Then Reese KICKS out the side window
and crawls out on his back. With bound hands Reese SMASHES
out the driver's side window. Hauls out a groggy Fusco.

Fusco fumbles for his weapon, but Reese already has it. He
relieves Fusco of his extra mags, cash, cell phone. Reese
hauls Fusco up, then turns him to face the water, gun pressed
to his back. Fusco is resigned to it. Ready to die.

                       REESE
           You wearing your vest, Officer?

Fusco nods. Reese EMPTIES Fusco's service automatic into
his back. Fusco GRUNTS in agony, then slumps to the ground.

Reese turns back. The sun is setting behind the distant
towers of the city. He starts the long walk back.

                     END OF ACT THREE
                                                            59.

                            ACT FOUR

EXT. CONDO BUILDING, QUEENS - NIGHT

A distant surveillance camera records an unmarked cruiser
pulling up alongside the building.

INT. UNMARKED CRUISER - NIGHT

Stills, riding shotgun, peers into the darkened lobby of
Miller's building. The door opens and AZARELLO, one of
Stills' men, climbs inside.

                       AZARELLO
           He's up there. He heads for the gym
           most nights. Doyle's on ten staking
           him out. He'll call when Miller
           heads down. Place is a dump.
           Practically every unit a foreclosure.
           We can take him in the lobby, no
           problem. It's under construction.
           No surveillance, no doorman, and I
           took care of the lights.

Stills taps the DRIVER.     The car pulls away.

INT.   STOLEN CAR - NIGHT

Reese is weaving the car through traffic. The steering column
is cracked open, wire harness pulled out. He reaches for
the glovebox. Finds a cell phone. Dials.

                        REESE
           Finch.   It's Reese.

INT. DERELICT LIBRARY - NIGHT -- INTERCUT

Finch, alone in the library, settles back into his chair,
overcome with relief.

                       FINCH
           Where the hell have-

                       REESE (V.O.)
           There's no time. I was wrong. Bray
           isn't the target. She's the
           ringleader. They're going after
           Miller. Tonight.

EXT.   ALLEYWAY BEHIND CONDOMINIUM - NIGHT

Stills climbs out of the car along with the other men.

                       STILLS
           Azarello and me take the lobby.
                       (MORE)
                                                            60.

                       STILLS (CONT'D)
               (to driver)
           Soon as it's done, I send the shooter
           out. You give him a block, maybe
           two, then take him out. Head shots.
           Don't take any chances. Understand?

Stills pulls out a Ziploc bag with a .38 special in it.
Pulls on leather gloves.

                       STILLS (CONT'D)
           Get our friend out of the trunk.

The driver pops the trunk and hauls out William Robinson,
the ex-con. Robinson is wide-eyed, terrified.

                       STILLS (CONT'D)
           Evening, William. You ready to settle
           that score?

Stills grabs Robinson and pushes him towards the open
emergency exit of the condo.

INT. LOBBY, MILLER'S CONDO - NIGHT

Stills pulls Robinson into the vestibule on one side of the
darkened lobby. Signals for the other cop to take up position
in the mail room on the other side of the lobby.

EXT. ALLEYWAY BEHIND CONDOMINIUM - NIGHT

The driver reverses down the alleyway to the next block,
keeping the emergency exit in sight. He kills the lights
but keeps the engine running.

Suddenly, there's movement by the side of the car. He reaches
for his weapon. Too late. He's yanked out of the car through
the open driver side window, then SLAMMED to the ground.

INT.   HALLWAY, TENTH FLOOR, MILLER'S CONDO - NIGHT

Another of Stills' men, DOYLE, watches from down the hallway.
Miller's front door opens, and he steps outside. Doyle
whispers into his cell phone.

                       DOYLE
           He's coming out now.   Wait-

Miller holds the door open a beat longer. His SON, 9, holding
a baseball glove and ball, follows him out. Miller takes
him by the hand and heads for the elevator.
                                                             61.

                      DOYLE (CONT'D)
              (into radio, whisper)
          Damn. He's got his kid with him.
          Must be heading to the ball game.

INT. LOBBY, MILLER'S CONDO - NIGHT

Stills listens. Azarello looks at him from across the lobby,
questioning. Stills shakes his head, undeterred. He pulls
Robinson roughly in front of him, puts the .38 in his hand,
then wraps his hand around Robinson's, forcing him to aim at
the elevator.

                      STILLS
          You're a very bad man, William.
          You're going to kill a man. And his
          son. What a waste.

                      ROBINSON
          Please... please don't do this...

Stills covers Robinson's mouth with his free hand. Watches
as the elevator numbers count down towards the lobby in the
dim light.

Suddenly, across the lobby, Azarello freezes. He's pushed
into the light, a gun pressed to his head. Standing behind
him is Reese.

Reese smiles at Stills. Puts a finger to his mouth. Shakes
his head, then pulls Azarello back into the darkness of the
mail room. Stills, furious, does as he's told and pulls
William back into the darkness of the vestibule.

DING. The elevator doors open. Miller and his son step
out. His son is throwing the ball up, then catching it as
they make their way through the silent, darkened lobby.

In the darkness of the mail room, Reese presses the barrel
of the gun hard against Azarello's temple.

Miller reaches the door to the street. Turns back to wait
for his son. Suddenly the boy DROPS his ball. It rolls
into the darkness of the mail room. The boy chases it.

Just inside the mailroom, the ball is stopped by a shoe.
The little boy looks up. Reese is standing there, one arm
holding Azarello, unseen, in the darkness. He smiles at the
boy, who stares up at him, wide-eyed, then grabs the ball
and runs back out to the lobby.

EXT. CONDO BUILDING, QUEENS - NIGHT

Miller takes his son by the hand, and they walk towards the
distant lights of Queens Boulevard. Safe. Alive.
                                                            62.

INT. LOBBY, MILLER'S CONDO - NIGHT

Reese pushes Azarello back into the lobby. Stills emerges
from the vestibule with Robinson. Reese gestures to him.

                        REESE
          Let him go.

                      STILLS
          I can't do that. I let him go, my
          friends and I will go to jail.

                      REESE
          If you don't let him go, I'm going
          to kill you. I don't particularly
          like killing people. But I'm very
          good at it. Understand?

The door to the stairwell opens, and Doyle walks out. Without
looking, Reese SHOOTS Doyle in the leg, then returns the
pistol to Azarello's head. Doyle lies on the ground, in
agony. Reese kicks his weapon away. Pushes Azarello forward.

                      REESE (CONT'D)
          Drag your friend outside and call an
          ambulance. You come back inside I
          kill you.

Azarello does as he's told. Reese re-trains his weapon on
Stills, who is still holding William. Stills follows suit,
aiming at Reese, holding William in front of him as a body
shield. After a moment the three of them are alone.

                      STILLS
          I don't think so. I think I kill
          you and your friend here. Make it
          look like you killed each other.
          Then, just because you pissed me
          off, I'm going to find your friends,
          and your family, and I'm going to
          kill all of them, too.

                      REESE
          I don't have any friends. Don't
          have any family left, either.
              (beat)
          You know why? Because I left them
          all behind. Went around the world
          looking for bad men. But there were
          plenty of you, right here, all along.

Stills grits his teeth, trying to decide.
                                                            63.

EXT. LOBBY, MILLER'S CONDO - NIGHT

The darkened lobby suddenly FLARES with GUNSHOTS. After a
moment, William pushes through the door, freaked but unharmed.
He looks around, then bolts.

EXT. LOBBY, MILLER'S CONDO - LATER

An ambulance is pulled in front of the building. EMTs are
loading Doyle into the back. A tiny CROWD has formed.

Down the block, in the darkness, Reese finishes loading
something into the trunk of his stolen car. Closes the trunk
lid, softly, then calls Finch.

                      REESE
          Miller and his kid are safe.

EXT. CITI FIELD - NIGHT

Finch, in the back of his town car, watches through the window
as Miller and his kid line up with the crowds waiting to get
into the game.

                       FINCH
          I know.
              (beat)
          Thank you.

Finch hangs up the phone.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

Bray is tuned out while the defense questions a WITNESS.
She checks her phone. Nothing from Stills.

                       JUDGE
          Miss Bray?

She looks up. Stands to her feet and begins her attack on
the witness. She turns to address the jury.

                      BRAY
          Why don't we let the defendant tell
          you in his own words. Let's listen
          to the 911 call he made the night in
          question.

Bray signals to the bailiff, who is standing over a tape
recorder. As she turns she catches sight of someone standing
at the back of the courtroom: Reese, standing by the door.
He smiles. Bray is shaken to her core.

The bailiff hits play. Bray looks away from Reese.   Ambient
hiss fills the courtroom.
                                                              64.

But the voice that plays isn't the defendant's.      It's hers.

                       BRAY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Then you take care of Miller.
           Tonight. Make it clean. And Stills?
           You screw this up, I won't let it
           get to me. I'll take care of you
           same as I took care of Pope.
           Understand?

Bray stands there, suddenly alone. She clutches at her
wrists, looking at the back of the courtroom. Reese is gone.

INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Doyle and the cop Reese kneecapped trying to abduct Michael
Pope are in bed, hooked up to IV drugs, watching the lead
item on the news: Bray being led out of court in handcuffs.
The recuperating cops look up as a group of UNIFORM POLICE
walk in, led by Carter. One of the uniform cops handcuffs
them to their gurneys as Carter reads them their rights.

INT. NINTH PRECINCT - DAY

Robinson takes a soda from a detective as another detective
continues to question him.

                        DETECTIVE
           So these guys start shooting and you
           just ran. And you say you don't
           know what happened to Stills?
               (off his look)
           And this mystery guy. The one who
           saved your life. You get a good
           look at him?

Robinson pauses a beat.     Not remembering.   Deciding.

                       ROBINSON
           Too dark in there. Got a good look
           at those cops, though.

The detective looks away.

INT.   MOTOR POOL, 42ND PRECINCT - DAY

Fusco walks along the line of cars, looking for his new
cruiser. He finds it in the darkness at the back of the
garage. Unlocks the door and climbs inside, stiff, ribs
bandaged.

INT.   CRUISER - DAY

Fusco checks the paperwork. Puts the key in the ignition.
He freezes as his pistol is pressed to the back of his head.
                                                              65.

                      REESE
          Good to see you again, Officer.
          Let's go for another drive.

Fusco doesn't look surprised -- he looks resigned to it.     He
puts the car in drive.

                      FUSCO
          Why not? I'm dead, anyway. Just a
          matter of time before the gangs get
          to me. Or I.A.D.

Fusco pulls out of the garage and onto the avenue.

                      REESE
          No one knows you're involved. I
          took care of that. Besides, they'll
          be too busy looking for Stills. The
          police will think he's made a run
          for it. The gangs and the mob will
          think he's gone witness protection.

                      FUSCO
          Is that where he is?   Witness
          Protection?

                        REESE
          No, Lionel.    He's in the trunk.

Fusco looks at Reese.   He's not kidding.     Fusco turns green.

                      REESE (CONT'D)
          I gave him a choice. He chose wrong.
          Problem is, I had to shoot him with
          your gun. And you'd have a hard
          time explaining that. Pull over at
          the next light. I'm not coming along
          this time.

                      FUSCO
          Coming where?

                      REESE
          Oyster Bay. No one's going to find
          him out there for a long, long time.
          But you get to dig the grave by
          yourself. I'll be in touch.

Reese turns the pistol around. Drops it on the seat next to
Fusco. Steps out. Fusco, defeated, waits for the light to
turn green.

EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT

Reese walks along the walkway. Finch is waiting for him.
Right at the spot we first met Reese, ready to jump.

                      REESE
          Funny place for a conversation.

                      FINCH
          Seemed appropriate. You see, you
          have a decision to make.

                      REESE
          The machine gave you another number.

                      FINCH
          The numbers never stop coming. You
          should know that. Upfront.
              (beat)
          If you want to leave, I'll give you
          as much money as you need. You could
          buy that boat. Disappear.

                      REESE
          And if I stay?

                      FINCH
          The truth? If you stay, and we
          continue to do this... sooner or
          later both of us will probably be
          killed.

                      REESE
          That's confidence-inspiring.

                      FINCH
          I said I'd tell you the truth. Not
          that you'd like it. They'll all be
          looking for you. The mob. The
          police. Your old friends at the
          CIA.

Reese looks out over the water.   Considers the drop.

                      REESE
          I never really liked boats, anyway.

INT. LOBBY, MILLER'S CONDO - NIGHT

Carter ducks under the yellow tape. The lobby is empty.
She walks to the vestibule. Pulls out her flashlight. Looks
at a crater on the wall where someone's dug out a bullet.

She heads for the exit to the alleyway.
                                                          67.

EXT. ALLEYWAY BEHIND CONDOMINIUM - NIGHT

Carter paces the alleyway, looking for more evidence. She
reaches the junction with another alleyway. In the distance
she can see the noise and people of Queens Boulevard. She
turns back. Hears a NOISE behind her. Almost as if he meant
it. She draws her weapon. Points it into the darkness.

                       CARTER
           You came back. Same reason as me.
           To make sure you hadn't left anything
           behind.

Silence.   Then, from the darkness:

                       REESE (O.S.)
           You said a project might be good for
           me. I think I found one.

                       CARTER
           Not exactly what I had in mind. I
           think I know what happened to your
           friend in New Rochelle. Maybe you
           had a good reason for what you did.
           But I've met a lot of bad guys. And
           they all thought they had a good
           reason.
               (beat)
           I'm going to catch you. Sooner or
           later.

                       REESE (O.S.)
           I used to think no one cared. No
           one was keeping score. I was wrong,
           wasn't I?
               (beat)
           I'll see you round, Detective.

Carter takes a deep breath.   Comes around the corner.

He's gone. She moves fast, covering the distance to the
bright lights of the boulevard.

EXT.   QUEENS BOULEVARD - NIGHT

Carter looks left. Right. No sign of him. She lowers her
weapon, stalking through the crowds, hunting.

He's standing in a crowd of people on the corner. For a
second she looks right at him. Then her eyes move on -- she
knows his voice but not what he looks like. She moves on.
He watches her pass. After a moment he steps out into the
street. Walks in the opposite direction. No one notices
him. No one except...
                                                            68.

P.O.V. SURVEILLANCE CAMERA

The camera's dead eye is fixed as Reese moves further and
further down the sidewalk.

INT. SECURE GOVERNMENT FACILITY - NIGHT

Rack after rack of servers. A massive warehouse filled with
them. The analyst shuts off the monitors. Then turns off
the lights. We're alone in the dark with the machines. We
pull in on one row. One server. A tiny yellow LED flickering
in the darkness.

P.O.V. SURVEILLANCE CAMERA

Reese keeps walking. He turns back, once. Then keeps
walking. After a moment, we SUPER TITLE: 'NON-RELEVANT TO
INVESTIGATION.' Then we-

Cut to black.

End.
